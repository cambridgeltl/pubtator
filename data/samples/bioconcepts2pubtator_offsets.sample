26102214|t|Mechanistic Effects of Calcitriol in Cancer Biology.
26102214|a|UNASSIGNED: Besides its classical biological effects on calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, calcitriol, the active vitamin D metabolite, has a broad variety of actions including anticancer effects that are mediated either transcriptionally and/or via non-genomic pathways. In the context of cancer, calcitriol regulates the cell cycle, induces apoptosis, promotes cell differentiation and acts as anti-inflammatory factor within the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we address the different mechanisms of action involved in the antineoplastic effects of calcitriol.

26073013|t|Influence of HEK293 metabolism on the production of viral vectors and vaccine.
26073013|a|UNASSIGNED: Mammalian cell cultures are increasingly used for the production of complex biopharmaceuticals including viral vectors and vaccines. HEK293 is the predominant cell line used for the transient expression of recombinant proteins and a well-established system for the production of viral vectors. Understanding metabolic requirements for high productivity in HEK293 cells remains an important area of investigation. Many authors have presented approaches for increased productivity through optimization of cellular metabolism from two distinct perspectives. One is a non-targeted approach, which is directed to improving feeding strategies by addition of exhausted or critical substrates and eventually removal of toxic metabolites. Alternatively, a targeted approach has attempted to identify specific targets for optimization through better understanding of the cellular metabolism under different operating conditions. This review will present both approaches and their successes with regards to improvement of viral production in HEK293 cells outlining the key relations between HEK293 cell metabolism and viral vector productivity. Also, we will summarize the current knowledge on HEK293 metabolism indicating remaining issues to address and problems to resolve to maximize the productivity of viral vectors in HEK293 cells.

26043292|t|Bleeding complications in pregnancies with low-lying placenta.
26043292|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate pregnancy outcomes with low-lying placenta according to the distance from placenta to cervical os. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies with low-lying placenta (placenta edge within 20   mm of internal os on transvaginal sonography) delivered at our hospital from 2002 to 2012, excluding suspected placenta accreta and vasa previa. Vaginal delivery was offered in the absence of another indication for cesarean. Outcomes were stratified according to placenta-os distance  <=10   mm and 11-20   mm. RESULTS: Of 98 pregnancies with low-lying placenta, 41% had placenta-os distance  <=10   mm and 59% placenta-os distance 11-20   mm. Fifty-four percent had a trial of labor. Six (15%) with placenta-os  <=10   mm and 21 (36%) with placenta-os 11-20   mm delivered vaginally, p   =   0.02. Bleeding necessitating cesarean occurred in 25%, and postpartum hemorrhage in 43%; neither complication associated with placenta-os distance. Third-trimester bleeding prior to delivery hospitalization was reported in 44% and associated with later bleeding requiring cesarean in 51% versus 4% of those without third-trimester bleeding, p   <   0.001. CONCLUSION: Whereas low-lying placenta does not contraindicate labor, we found significant risk for bleeding complications, regardless of the planned mode of delivery. Placenta-os distance did not significantly affect outcomes in our series.

26042639|t|The Cephalostatins. 24. Isolation, Structure, and Cancer Cell Growth Inhibition of Cephalostatin 20.
26042639|a|UNASSIGNED: For the purpose of advancing knowledge of the structural variations available in the natural cephalostatins contained in the marine worm Cephalodiscus gilchristi, the isolation and structure of the 20th member (1) has been accomplished (10(-7) % yield). In turn cephalostatin 20 (1) proved to be enough for an initial SAR study comprising six important human cancer cell lines. A parallel objective was aimed at the possible discovery of a natural cephalostatin with a more accessible structure for total synthesis and/or synthetic modifications, but with powerful cancer cell growth inhibition.

26024081|t|What you see is what you step: the horizontal-vertical illusion increases toe clearance in older adults during stair ascent.
26024081|a|PURPOSE: Falls on stairs are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly people. A simple safety strategy to avoid tripping on stairs is increasing foot clearance. We determined whether a horizontal-vertical illusion superimposed onto stairs to create an illusory perceived increase in stair-riser height would increase stair ascent foot clearance in older participants. METHODS: Preliminary experiments determined the optimum parameters for the horizontal-vertical illusion. Fourteen older adults (mean age    1 SD, 68.5    7.4 years) ascended a three-step staircase with the optimized version of the horizontal-vertical illusion (spatial frequency: 12 cycles per stair riser) positioned either on the bottom or top stair only, or on the bottom and top stair simultaneously. These were compared to a control condition, which had a plain stair riser with edge highlighters positioned flush with each stair-tread edge. Foot clearance and measures of postural stability were compared across conditions. RESULTS: The optimized illusion on the bottom and top stair led to a significant increase in foot clearance over the respective stair edge, compared to the control condition. There were no significant decreases in postural stability. CONCLUSIONS: An optimized horizontal-vertical visual illusion led to significant increases in foot clearance in older adults when ascending a staircase, but the effects did not destabilize their postural stability. Inclusion of the horizontal-vertical illusion on raised surfaces (e.g., curbs) or the bottom and top stairs of staircases could improve stair ascent safety in older adults.

26026123|t|Suicidal Ideation Versus Hopelessness/Helplessness in Healthy Individuals and in Patients with Benign Breast Disease and Breast Cancer: A Prospective Case-control Study in Finland.
26026123|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: The relation between suicidal ideation versus hopelessness/helplessness in healthy study subjects (HSS) and in patients with benign breast disease (BBD) and breast cancer (BC) has not been compared to date in a prospective study. We, therefore, investigated suicidal ideation versus hopelessness/helplessness in 115 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the Kuopio Breast Cancer Study, 115 women with breast symptoms were evaluated for hopelessness and helplessness versus suicidal/pessimistic thoughts before any diagnostic procedures were carried-out. RESULTS: In the self-rating score (SRS), hopelessness and the helplessness versus pessimistic thoughts were significantly correlated in the HSS, BBD and BC groups. In the SRS, the weighted kappa-values for hopelessness versus pessimistic thoughts in the BBD group were also statistically significant. There was also a significant positive correlation in the examiner-rating score (ERS) in the hopelessness versus pessimistic thoughts in the HSS, BBD and BC groups, as well as in the ERS, in the helplessness versus pessimistic thoughts in the HSS and BBD groups. In SRS, the hopelessness and the helplessness versus suicidal thoughts were significantly correlated in the HSS, BBD and BC groups. There was also a significant positive correlation in the ERS in the hopelessness versus suicidal thoughts in the HSS, BBD and BC groups, as well as in the ERS, in the helplessness versus suicidal thoughts in the BBD group. CONCLUSION: A new finding with clinical relevance in the present work is the agreement between hopelessness/helplessness versus suicidal/pessimistic thoughts in the self-rating and examiner-rating. In the breast cancer diagnostic Unit, the identification of suicidal ideation is essential in suicide prevention and it is important to assess and treat depression even though a subject reports little suicidal ideation.

26023054|t|Synthesis of pyrazolylbisindoles over mesoporous Lewis acidic ZrTUD-1: Potential application in selective Cu(2+) colorimetric detection.
26023054|a|UNASSIGNED: A series of pyrazolylbisindole (PBI) derivatives were prepared by simple condensation of indole and pyrazole aldehyde utilizing amorphous mesoporous ZrTUD-1 having predominant Lewis acid sites. The applicability of pyrazolylbisindolyl derivate as a colorimetric chemosensor with high selectivity toward Cu(2+) over other cations were tested. Among heavy and transition metal (HTM) ions in CH3CN solution, the probe only sensed Cu(2+) detectable by naked eye. The sensor exhibited a new absorption band at 488nm (a red shift of 206nm from 282nm) with a large colorimetric response and affinity to Cu(2+) over other cations tested (Al(3+), Pb(2+), Cd(2+), Mg(2+), Mn(2+), Zn(2+), K(+), Fe(2+), Ca(2+), Cu(2+) and Hg(2+)).

26021905|t|Wear Patterns in Knee Articular Surfaces in Varus Deformity.
26021905|a|UNASSIGNED: This study was performed to study the relationship between the degree of varus deformity of osteoarthritic knees and the anatomic distribution of cartilage pathology. Bone wafers resected from the distal femur and proximal tibia were obtained from 107 patients (195 knees) with primary varus osteoarthritis. Severity and distribution of joint damage was scored for each articular surface and related to potential prognostic factors, including varus deformity, the ligamentous status of the knee, age, gender and BMI. There was highly significant association between varus angulation of the knee and the total damage score for the tibia (P=0.001), but not the femur (P=0.2947). The degree of deformity, and not the status of the ACL alone, determines wear pattern and provides insight for preoperative planning of TKA.

26078102|t|Edge-Centered DTI Connectivity Analysis: Application to Schizophrenia.
26078102|a|UNASSIGNED: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides connectivity information that helps illuminate the processes underlying normal development as well as brain disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Researchers have widely adopted graph representations to model DTI connectivity among brain structures; however, most measures of connectivity have been centered on nodes, rather than edges, in these graphs. We present an edge-based algorithm for assessing anatomic connectivity; this approach provides information about connections among brain structures, rather than information about structures themselves. This perspective allows us to formulate multivariate graph-based models of altered connectivity that distinguish among experimental groups. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by analyzing data from an ongoing study of schizophrenia.

26088129|t|Non-communicable diseases and preventive health behaviors: a comparison of Hispanics nationally and those living along the US-Mexico border.
26088129|a|BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are rising among US Hispanics, but few studies have examined the preventive health behaviors for these NCDs among Hispanics. This study compared the preventive health behaviors of smoke-free living, physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and avoidance of heavy alcohol use in Hispanics in the United States and Hispanics living along the US-Mexico border. METHODS: Two weighted data sets with information on Hispanic populations were analyzed: 1) the national Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (n   =   29,942) from 2009; and 2) the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (n   =   1,439) recruited from the US-Mexico border between 2008-2011. To compare the preventive health behaviors of the samples, within a generalized estimating equation framework, weighted univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted controlling for age, educational attainment, employment, language, and insurance status. Statistical tests were two-sided with a significance level set at 0.05. RESULTS: Both samples reported low engagement in preventive behaviors. However, Hispanic males and females from the US-Mexico border were significantly less likely than the national sample to meet physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption guidelines. Also, Hispanic males from the US-Mexico border were more likely to engage in heavy alcohol use. CONCLUSION: The lack of preventive health behaviors among Hispanics living along the US-Mexico border presents a dire prospect for NCD control in the region. Multipronged approaches to address multiple behaviors should be considered.

26088119|t|Off-Label Trazodone Prescription: Evidence, Benefits and Risks.
26088119|a|UNASSIGNED: Although trazodone is approved and marketed in most countries worldwide for the sole treatment of Major Depressive Disorder, the use for this medication is very common for many other conditions, such as primary or secondary insomnia, Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Other, not officially approved, uses of trazodone include: the treatment of bulimia, benzodiazepine and/or alcohol dependence or abuse, fibromyalgia, degenerative diseases of the central nervous system such as dementia and other organic disorders, schizophrenia, chronic pain, and diabetic neuropathy. In addition, due to its 5HT2A receptor antagonistic action, trazodone may be used to prevent the occurrence of initial and long-term side effects of SSRI, such as anxiety, insomnia and sexual dysfunction. Despite the favorable clinical experience and the encouraging results from the studies that have tested the efficacy of trazodone for some of its off-label indications, it is paramount that large, randomized and controlled clinical trials be conducted in the near future to evaluate which of the many off-label indications are supported by a strong scientific evidence.

26089297|t|GP trainees' in-consultation information-seeking: associations with human, paper and electronic sources.
26089297|a|BACKGROUND: Answering clinical questions arising from patient care can improve that care and offers an opportunity for adult learning. It is also a vital component in practising evidence-based medicine. GPs' sources of in-consultation information can be human or non-human (either hard copy or electronic). OBJECTIVES: To establish the prevalence and associations of GP trainees' in-consultation information-seeking, and to establish the prevalence of use of different sources of information (human, hard copy and electronic) and the associations of choosing particular sources. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of data (2010-13) from an ongoing cohort study of Australian GP trainees' consultations. Once each 6-month training term, trainees record detailed data of 60 consecutive consultations. The primary outcome was whether the trainee sought in-consultation information for a problem/diagnosis. Secondary outcomes were whether information-seeking was from a human (GP, other specialist or other health professional) or from a non-human source (electronic or hard copy), and whether a non-human source was electronic or hard copy. RESULTS: Six hundred forty-five trainees (response rate 94.3%) contributed data for 84 723 consultations including 131 583 problems/diagnoses. In-consultation information was sought for 15.4% (95% confidence interval = 15.3-15.6) of problems/diagnoses. Sources were: GP in 6.9% of problems/diagnoses, other specialists 0.9%, other health professionals 0.6%, electronic sources 6.5% and hard-copy sources 1.5%. Associations of information-seeking included younger patient age, trainee full-time status and earlier training stage, longer consultation duration, referring the patient, organizing follow-up and generating learning goals. Associations of choosing human information sources (over non-human sources) were similar, but also included the trainee's training organization. Associations of electronic rather than hard-copy information-seeking included the trainee being younger, the training organization and information-seeking for management rather than diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Trainee information-seeking is mainly from GP colleagues and electronic sources. Human information-sources are preferentially sought for more complex problems, even by these early-career GPs who have trained in the 'internet era'.

26083040|t|Negative-Pressure Cavitation Extraction of Secoisolariciresinol Diglycoside from Flaxseed Cakes.
26083040|a|UNASSIGNED: The negative-pressure cavitation extraction (NPCE) technique was applied firstly to extract secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) from flaxseed cakes. The significant extraction parameters were screened by fractional factorial design (FFD). The optimal parameters were determined using the central composite design (CCD) with the two variables, NaOH amount and the liquid/solid ratio. The conditions of the extraction were optimized by using response surface methodology (RSM). Under the optimal conditions, the extraction yield and the extraction purity of SDG was 16.25 mg/g and 3.86%, respectively. The efficiency of NPCE was compared with that of conventional extraction methods. Our results demonstrated that NPCE was comparable to the well-known ultrasound-assisted extraction in term of extraction yield and purity. This extraction technique has advantages of less time-consuming, low solvent usage and high throughput capability.

26022941|t|RNA biomarkers to facilitate the identification of aggressive prostate cancer.
26022941|a|UNASSIGNED: A large number of men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, but many will not experience morbidity or mortality as a result of their cancers. Therefore, biomarkers for prostate cancer are necessary to carefully select patients for initial diagnostic biopsy or to facilitate care decisions for men who have already been diagnosed with prostate cancer. RNA-based approaches to biomarker discovery allow the investigation of non-coding RNAs, gene fusion transcripts, splice variants, and multi-gene expression panels in tissue, urine, or blood as opportunities to improve care decisions. This review focuses on RNA biomarkers that are available as commercial assays, and therefore already available for potential clinical use, as well as providing an overview of newer RNA biomarkers that are in earlier stages of clinical development.

26080589|a|Visual impairment is often one of the earliest sings of Alzheimer's disease. This article reports a clinical case of a female patient diagnosed with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. As revealed by a comprehensive examination, her visual fields and visual evoked potentials were markedly changed, while morphometric parameters of the retina and optic nerve appeared normal. Such a significant dissociation of structural and functional parameters may indicate a more proximal involvement of visual pathways in Alzheimer's disease.

26083222|a|UNASSIGNED: To the Editor: Wigley et al. (March 12 issue)(1) discuss the case of a 68-year-old man with multiple myeloma and scleroderma. Notably, autologous stem-cell transplantation had been performed 7 months before the symptoms of scleroderma appeared in the patient. Thus, the diagnosis of autologous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) should be considered. GVHD is the major complication of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, and sclerodermatous GVHD accounts for 3.4% of GVHD cases.(2),(3) There is little difference between sclerodermatous GVHD and scleroderma with regard to clinical and histologic features except the distinct histories. A similar syndrome termed autologous GVHD affects patients after autologous stem-cell .  .  .

26083448|t|Coupling mitogenesis and mitophagy for longevity.
26083448|a|UNASSIGNED: Maintenance of mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis requires both generation of newly synthesized and elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria. Impaired mitochondrial function and excessive mitochondrial content are major characteristics of ageing and several human pathophysiological conditions, highlighting the pivotal role of the coordination between mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy. However, the cellular and molecular underpinnings of mitochondrial mass homeostasis remain obscure. In our recent study, we demonstrate that DCT-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of mammalian BNIP3 and BNIP3L/NIX, is a key mediator of mitophagy promoting longevity under stress. DCT-1 acts downstream of the PINK-1-PDR-1/Parkin pathway and is ubiquitinated upon mitophagy-inducing conditions to mediate the removal of damaged mitochondria. Accumulation of damaged mitochondria triggers SKN-1 activation, which initiates a bipartite retrograde signaling pathway stimulating the coordinated induction of both mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy genes. Taken together, our results unravel a homeostatic feedback loop that allows cells to adjust their mitochondrial population in response to environmental and intracellular cues. Age-dependent decline of mitophagy both inhibits removal of dysfunctional or superfluous mitochondria and impairs mitochondrial biogenesis resulting in progressive mitochondrial accretion and consequently, deterioration of cell function.

26081628|t|Outcome and prognosis of hypoxic brain damage patients undergoing neurological early rehabilitation.
26081628|a|BACKGROUND: The prevalence of patients suffering from hypoxic brain damage is increasing. Long-term outcome data and prognostic factors for either poor or good outcome are lacking. METHODS: This retrospective study included 93 patients with hypoxic brain damage undergoing neurological early rehabilitation [length of stay: 108.5 (81.9) days]. Clinical data, validated outcome scales (e.g. Barthel Index-BI, Early Rehabilitation Index-ERI, Glasgow Coma Scale-GCS, Coma Remission Scale-CRS), neuroimaging data, electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potentials were analyzed. RESULTS: 75.3% had a poor outcome (defined as BI <50). 38 (40.9%) patients were discharged to a nursing care facility, 21 (22.6%) to subsequent rehabilitation, 17 (18.3%) returned home, 9 (9.7%) needed further acute-care hospital treatment and 8 (8.6%) died. Barthel Index on admission as well as coma length were strong predictors of outcome from hypoxic brain damage. In addition, duration of vegetative instability, prolongation of wave III in visual evoked potentials (flash VEP), theta and delta rhythm in EEG, ERI, GCS and CRS on admission were related to poor outcome. All patients with bilateral hypodensities of the basal ganglia belonged to the poor outcome group. Age had no independent influence on functional status at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: As with other studies on neurological rehabilitation, functional status on admission turned out to be a strong predictor of outcome from hypoxic brain damage.

26082802|t|Evidence that homozygous PTPRD gene microdeletion causes trigonocephaly, hearing loss, and intellectual disability.
26082802|a|BACKGROUND: The premature fusion of metopic sutures results in the clinical phenotype of trigonocephaly. An association of this characteristic with the monosomy 9p syndrome is well established and the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase gene (PTPRD), located in the 9p24.1p23 region and encoding a major component of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic organization, is considered as a good candidate to be responsible for this form of craniosynostosis. Moreover PTPRD is known to recruit multiple postsynaptic partners such as IL1RAPL1 which gene alterations lead to non syndromic intellectual disability (ID). RESULTS: We describe a 30 month old boy with severe intellectual disability, trigonocephaly and dysmorphic facial features such as a midface hypoplasia, a flat nose, a depressed nasal bridge, hypertelorism, a long philtrum and a drooping mouth. Microarray chromosomal analysis revealed the presence of a homozygous deletion involving the PTPRD gene, located on chromosome 9p22.3. Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplifications all along the gene failed to amplify the patient's cDNA in fibroblasts, indicating the presence of two null PTPRD alleles. Synaptic PTPRD interacts with IL1RAPL1 which defects have been associated with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder. The absence of the PTPRD transcript leads to a decrease in the expression of IL1RAPL1. These results suggest the direct involvement of PTPRD in ID, which is consistent with the PTPRD -/- mice phenotype. Deletions of PTPRD have been previously suggested as a cause of trigonocephaly in patients with monosomy 9p and genome-wide association study suggested variations in PTPRD are associated with hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS: The deletion identified in the reported patient supports previous hypotheses on its function in ID and hearing loss. However, its involvement in the occurrence of metopic synostosis is still to be discussed as more investigation of patients with the 9p monosomy syndrome is required.

26082592|t|Polycyclic Annular Lesion Masquerading as Lupus Erythematosus and Emerging as Tinea Faciei Incognito.
26082592|a|Tinea incognito is a dermatophytic infection induced by immunosuppressive agents that lacks the classic features of a typical fungal infection. Although the treatment of tinea incognito is simple and relatively easy, its clinical manifestation varies and can masquerade as various skin disorders, causing misdiagnosis and thus preventing prompt and appropriate treatment. Here, we report an interesting case of tinea incognito occurring after topical steroid administration in an immunosuppressed patient with dermatitis artefacta. A 40-year-old female patient who had been taking systemic glucocorticoid for 4 years for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy presented with itching multiple erythematous erosive lesions on the face and upper chest for 2 months. Initial biopsy produced nonspecific findings. The skin lesion was aggravated and became polycyclic and erythematous; after azathioprine was added, her chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy became aggravated. A second biopsy confirmed hyphae in the cornified layer. Complete remission was achieved after admonishing oral terbinafine and topical amorolfine.

26083664|t|Brain Mechanisms Supporting Violated Expectations of Pain.
26083664|a|UNASSIGNED: The subjective experience of pain is influenced by interactions between prior experiences, future predictions and incoming afferent information. Expectations of high pain can exacerbate pain while expectations of low pain during a consistently noxious stimulus can produce significant reductions in pain. However, the brain mechanisms associated with processing mismatches between expected and experienced pain are poorly understood, but are important for imparting salience to a sensory event in order to override erroneous top-down expectancy-mediated information. The present investigation examined pain-related brain activation when expectations of pain were abruptly violated. After conditioning participants to cues predicting low or high pain, ten incorrectly cued stimuli were administered across 56 stimulus trials to determine if expectations would be less influential on pain when there is a high discordance between pre-stimulus cues and corresponding thermal stimulation. Incorrectly cued stimuli produced pain ratings and pain-related brain activation consistent with placebo analgesia, nocebo hyperalgesia, and violated expectations. Violated expectations of pain were associated with activation in distinct regions of the inferior parietal lobe, including the supramarginal and angular gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus, the superior parietal lobe, cerebellum and occipital lobe. Thus, violated expectations of pain engage mechanisms supporting salience-driven sensory discrimination, working memory, and associative learning processes. By overriding the influence of expectations on pain, these brain mechanisms are likely engaged in clinical situations where patients' unrealistic expectations for pain relief diminish the efficacy of pain treatments. Accordingly, these findings underscore the importance of maintaining realistic expectations to augment the effectiveness of pain management.

26092342|t|High-throughput characterization of sediment organic matter by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and multivariate curve resolution: A promising analytical tool in (paleo)limnology.
26092342|a|Molecular-level chemical information about organic matter (OM) in sediments helps to establish the sources of OM and the prevalent degradation/diagenetic processes, both essential for understanding the cycling of carbon (C) and of the elements associated with OM (toxic trace metals and nutrients) in lake ecosystems. Ideally, analytical methods for characterizing OM should allow high sample throughput, consume small amounts of sample and yield relevant chemical information, which are essential for multidisciplinary, high-temporal resolution and/or large spatial scale investigations. We have developed a high-throughput analytical method based on pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and automated data processing to characterize sedimentary OM in sediments. Our method consumes 200 g of freeze-dried and ground sediment sample. Pyrolysis was performed at 450  C, which was found to avoid degradation of specific biomarkers (e.g., lignin compounds, fresh carbohydrates/cellulose) compared to 650  C, which is in the range of temperatures commonly applied for environmental samples. The optimization was conducted using the top ten sediment samples of an annually resolved sediment record (containing 16-18% and 1.3-1.9% of total carbon and nitrogen, respectively). Several hundred pyrolytic compound peaks were detected of which over 200 were identified, which represent different classes of organic compounds (i.e., n-alkanes, n-alkenes, 2-ketones, carboxylic acids, carbohydrates, proteins, other N compounds, (methoxy)phenols, (poly)aromatics, chlorophyll and steroids/hopanoids). Technical reproducibility measured as relative standard deviation of the identified peaks in triplicate analyses was 5.5  4.3%, with 90% of the RSD values within 10% and 98% within 15%. Finally, a multivariate calibration model was calculated between the pyrolytic degradation compounds and the sediment depth (i.e., sediment age), which is a function of degradation processes and changes in OM source type. This allowed validation of the Py-GC/MS dataset against fundamental processes involved in OM cycling in aquatic ecosystems.

26090519|t|New macrophage models of Gaucher disease offer new tools for drug development.
26090519|a|UNASSIGNED: Gaucher disease is an inherited enzyme deficiency resulting in the lysosomal accumulation of specific glycolipids in macrophages and, in some cases, neurons. While current treatments are effective at reducing this glycolipid storage in macrophages, they are expensive and ineffective in treating neurological manifestations of the disease, driving the search for novel therapeutics. Moreover, mutations in GBA1, the gene implicated in Gaucher disease, are an important risk factor for the development of Parkinson disease and related disorders, an association that has further heightened interest in Gaucher disease research. However, the development of therapeutic strategies has been hampered by a shortage of appropriate cellular models of Gaucher disease. We have generated two novel macrophage models of Gaucher disease, one through the differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes from patients with Gaucher disease and the other through the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patient fibroblasts. Both disease models demonstrate similar cellular phenotypes and exhibit extensive glycolipid storage when exposed to exogenous lipid sources such as erythrocyte membranes. Furthermore, we have used these models to confirm the efficacy of a novel small molecule in clearing glycolipid storage and restoring normal macrophage function. These results demonstrate the usefulness of these models in exploring new therapeutics for Gaucher disease and related disorders.

26098167|t|Life Span Decrements in Fluid Intelligence and Processing Speed Predict Mortality Risk.
26098167|a|UNASSIGNED: We examined life span changes in 5 domains of cognitive performance as predictive of mortality risk. Data came from the Manchester Longitudinal Study of Cognition, a 20-plus-year investigation of 6,203 individuals ages 42-97 years. Cognitive domains were general crystallized intelligence, general fluid intelligence, verbal memory, visuospatial memory, and processing speed. Life span decrements were evident across these domains, controlling for baseline performance at age 70 and adjusting for retest effects. Survival analyses stratified by sex and conducted independently by cognitive domain showed that lower baseline performance levels in all domains-and larger life span decrements in general fluid intelligence and processing speed-were predictive of increased mortality risk for both women and men. Critically, analyses of the combined predictive power of cognitive performance variables showed that baseline levels of processing speed (in women) and general fluid intelligence (in men), and decrements in processing speed (in women and in men) and general fluid intelligence (in women), accounted for most of the explained variation in mortality risk. In light of recent evidence from brain-imaging studies, we speculate that cognitive abilities closely linked to cerebral white matter integrity (such as processing speed and general fluid intelligence) may represent particularly sensitive markers of mortality risk. In addition, we presume that greater complexity in cognition-survival associations observed in women (in analyses incorporating all cognitive predictors) may be a consequence of longer and more variable cognitive declines in women relative to men.

26098973|t|Probing Majorana bound states via counting statistics of a single electron transistor.
26098973|a|UNASSIGNED: We propose an approach for probing Majorana bound states (MBSs) in a nanowire via counting statistics of a nearby charge detector in the form of a single-electron transistor (SET). We consider the impacts on the counting statistics by both the local coupling between the detector and an adjacent MBS at one end of a nanowire and the nonlocal coupling to the MBS at the other end. We show that the Fano factor and the skewness of the SET current are minimized for a symmetric SET configuration in the absence of the MBSs or when coupled to a fermionic state. However, the minimum points of operation are shifted appreciably in the presence of the MBSs to asymmetric SET configurations with a higher tunnel rate at the drain than at the source. This feature persists even when varying the nonlocal coupling and the pairing energy between the two MBSs. We expect that these MBS-induced shifts can be measured experimentally with available technologies and can serve as important signatures of the MBSs.

26097577|t|Associations between the properties of the cartilage matrix and findings from quantitative MRI in human osteoarthritic cartilage of the knee.
26097577|a|UNASSIGNED: The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the properties of the cartilage matrix and the results of T2 mapping and delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (dGEMRIC) in human knee osteoarthritic cartilage. Osteochondral samples were harvested from the middle part of the femoral condyle and tibial plateaus of 20 patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) during total knee arthroplasty. Sagittal T2 mapping, T1pre, and T1Gd were performed using 7.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Gycosaminoglycan (GAG) distribution was evaluated by OARSI, collagen anisotropy was assessed by polarized light microscopy (PLM), and biochemical analyses measured water, GAG, and collagen content. Associations between properties of the cartilage matrix and T2 and   R1 (1/T1Gd-1/T1pre) values were explored using correlation analysis. T2 and   R1 values were significantly correlated with the degree of cartilage degeneration (OARSI grade;    = 0.53 and 0.77). T2 values were significantly correlated with water content (r = 0.69; P < 0.001), GAG content (r = -0.43; P < 0.001), and PLM grade (r = 0.47; P < 0.001), but not with collagen content (r = -0.02; P = 0.110).   R1 values were significantly correlated with GAG content (r = -0.84; P < 0.001) and PLM grade (r = 0.41; P < 0.001). Taken together, T2 mapping and dGEMRIC results were correlated with the properties of the cartilage matrix in human knee osteoarthritic cartilage. Combination T2 mapping and dGEMRIC represents a potential non-invasive monitoring technique to detect the progress of knee OA.

26001704|t|Introduction of rapid syphilis testing in antenatal care: A systematic review of the impact on HIV and syphilis testing uptake and coverage.
26001704|a|BACKGROUND: Global guidelines recommend universal syphilis and HIV screening for pregnant women. Rapid syphilis testing (RST) may contribute toward achievement of universal screening. OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of RST on syphilis and HIV screening among pregnant women. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE for English- and non-English language articles published through November, 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies that used a comparative design and reported on syphilis and HIV test uptake among pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) following introduction of RST. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted from six eligible articles presenting findings from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. MAIN RESULTS: All studies reported substantial increases in antenatal syphilis testing following introduction of RST; the latter did not appear to adversely impact antenatal HIV screening levels at sites already offering rapid HIV testing and may increase HIV screening among pregnant women in some settings. Qualitative data revealed that women were highly satisfied with RST. Nevertheless, ensuring adequate training for healthcare workers and supplies of commodities were cited as key implementation barriers. CONCLUSIONS: RST may increase antenatal syphilis and HIV screening and contribute to the improvement of antenatal care in LMICs.

26097493|t|Lipodystrophy among HIV-infected patients: a cross-sectional study on impact on quality of life and mental health disorders.
26097493|a|BACKGROUND: Lipodystrophy (LD) is a frequent adverse event of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) and occurs mainly in patients exposed to first-generation antiretroviral drugs. The aim of this study was to explore and measure the interaction between LD, mental health, and quality of life of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive individuals seen in a metabolic clinic. METHODS: We conducted a single-site cross-sectional study including all HIV-infected patients attending the LIPO group and metabolism day clinic at the University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland between January 31, 2008 and November 28, 2013. Data on LD were prospectively collected using the HIV Outpatient Study (HOPS) score, the Lipodystrophy Case Definition (LDCD), ART regimens, anthropometric measures, imaging, and standardized questionnaires. Quality of life was evaluated using a visual analog scale of 0-100. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory scales, respectively. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-four patients (54.6% male; 45.4% female; median age, 50  years) on successful ART (median CD4 cell count, 569.0 cells/mm(3); median viral load, 20  copies/mL) were evaluated. Among these, 62.7, 63.5 and 35.5% of patients reported at least one body site affected by fat hypertrophy, atrophy or both, respectively. Using the LDCD score conservative definition, including imaging and biological values, 57.8% were diagnosed with LD. Of these, 39.7% suffered from severe/very severe LD. Depression was reported by 35.6% of individuals; 51.9% had anxiety symptoms and 49.5% reported poor quality of life (defined as being inferior to 50% on a scale from 0 to 100%). LD (odds ratio (OR  =  5.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-25.37, p-value: 0.040), depression (OR  =  4.67, 95% CI 1.08-20.31, p-value 0.040), and anxiety (OR  =  7.83, 95% CI 1.91-32.03, p-value 0.004) all affected significantly the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: LD, depression and anxiety were frequent features among HIV-infected individuals seen in the metabolic clinic and significantly impacted on their quality of life.

26096016|t|Adherence to the lymphadenectomy recommendations of the 2009 clinical guidelines in the 2010 National Prostate Cancer Registry.
26096016|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the adherence to the recommendations of the 2009 clinical guidelines in the implementation of lymphadenectomy during radical prostatectomy and analysis of the variables that influence this decision in the 2010 National Prostate Cancer Registry. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Analysis of 1,272 patients who underwent prostatectomy in 25 national hospitals. Patient classification according to the pathological node-positive (pN+) risk criteria included in the clinical guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). Calculation of the raw agreement and index of agreement kappa. Logistic regression to assess the predictors in the decision to perform lymphadenectomy. RESULTS: Lymphadenectomy was performed on 225 (17.7%) patients, with a variability among centers of 0-62.2% (p<.001). There was lymphocytic invasion (pN+) in 17 (7.5%) patients. The raw agreement with the EAU-09 clinical guidelines was .672 (.48-.96 in the various centers), and the kappa index was .289. The raw agreement with the NCCN-09 clinical guidelines was.814 (.51-1 in the various centers), and the kappa index was .228. In the multivariate analysis, the independent predictors for performing lymphadenectomy were the Gleason score, the clinical stage, the prostate-specific antigen, the hospital center and the surgical approach route to prostatectomy (all P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, adherence to the recommendations of the clinical guidelines on the implementation of lymphadenectomy was moderate. When deciding on lymphadenectomy, the determinants (in addition to the classic clinical variables) were the approach route and the hospital where the prostatectomy was performed.

26096959|t|pH-Responsive H-Type PMAA2 -b-HTPBN-b-PMAA2 Four-Arm Star Block Copolymer Micelles for PTX Drug Release.
26096959|a|UNASSIGNED: pH-Responsive H-type poly(methylacrylic acid-block-four hydroxyl terminated poly(butadiene-acrylobitrile)-block-poly(methylacrylic acid (PMAA2 -b-HTPBN-b-PMAA2 ) block copolymers were synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization and the follow-up hydrolysis, and characterized by (1) H NMR, FT-IR and SEC. The block copolymers could self-assemble into nanoscale spherical core-shell micelle aggregates in aqueous solution, and the physicochemical properties depended on the system composition and pH media, with pH phase transition at 5.7-6.1. The copolymer micelle aggregates exhibited pH-triggered drug release and cytotoxicity, and could potentially be used as drug targeting release carriers.

26098639|t|Antioxidant Activity of Caffeic Acid against Iron-Induced Free Radical Generation-A Chemical Approach.
26098639|a|UNASSIGNED: Caffeic acid (CA) is a phenolic compound widely found in coffee beans with known beneficial effects in vivo. Many studies showed that CA has anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic, antibacterial and anti-carcinogenic properties, which could be linked to its antioxidant activity. Taking in consideration the reported in vitro antioxidant mechanism of other polyphenols, our working hypothesis was that the CA antioxidant activity could be related to its metal-chelating property. With that in mind, we sought to investigate the chemical antioxidant mechanism of CA against in vitro iron-induced oxidative damage under different assay conditions. CA was able to prevent hydroxyl radical formation promoted by the classical Fenton reaction, as determined by 2-deoxyribose (2-DR) oxidative degradation and DMPO hydroxylation. In addition to its ability to prevent hydroxyl radical formation, CA had a great inhibition of membrane lipid peroxidation. In the lipid peroxidation assays CA acted as both metal-chelator and as hydrogen donor, preventing the deleterious action promoted by lipid-derived peroxyl and alkoxyl radicals. Our results indicate that the observed antioxidant effects were mostly due to the formation of iron-CA complexes, which are able to prevent 2-DR oxidation and DMPO hydroxylation. Noteworthy, the formation of iron-CA complexes and prevention of oxidative damage was directly related to the pH of the medium, showing better antioxidant activity at higher pH values. Moreover, in the presence of lipid membranes the antioxidant potency of CA was much higher, indicating its enhanced effectiveness in a hydrophobic environment. Overall, our results show that CA acts as an antioxidant through an iron chelating mechanism, preventing the formation of free hydroxyl radicals and, therefore, inhibiting Fenton-induced oxidative damage. The chemical properties of CA described here-in association with its reported signaling effects-could be an explanation to its beneficial effects observed in vivo.

26098342|t|Evolutionary Divergence of Adult Body Size and Juvenile Growth in Sympatric Subpopulations of a Top Predator in Aquatic Ecosystems.
26098342|a|UNASSIGNED: Evolutionary theory predicts that different selective regimes may contribute to divergent evolution of body size and growth rate among populations, but most studies have focused on allopatric populations. Here, we studied five sympatric subpopulations of anadromous northern pike (Esox lucius) in the Baltic Sea subjected to allopatric habitats for a short period of their life cycle due to homing behavior. We report differences in adult body size among subpopulations that were in part due to variation in growth rate. Body size of emigrating juveniles also differed among subpopulations, and differences remained when individuals were reared in a common environment, thus indicating evolutionary divergence among subpopulations. Furthermore, a QST-FST comparison indicated that differences had evolved due to divergent selection rather than genetic drift, possibly in response to differences in selective mortality among spawning habitats during the allopatric life stage. Adult and juvenile size were negatively correlated across subpopulations, and reconstruction of growth trajectories of adult fishes suggested that body size differences developed gradually and became accentuated throughout the first years of life. These results represent rare evidence that sympatric subpopulations can evolve differences in key life-history traits despite being subjected to allopatric habitats during only a very short fraction of their life.

26068055|t|Total and Proteinase K-Resistant a-Synuclein Levels in Erythrocytes, Determined by their Ability to Bind Phospholipids, Associate with Parkinson's Disease.
26068055|a|A marker for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD), which reflects on the occurrence of peripheral pathogenic mechanisms, would potentially improve therapy. The significance of a-Synuclein (a-Syn) expression in red blood cells (RBC) is currently unclear. Here we investigated whether RBC's-expressed a-Syn may associate with PD. To this aim, we determined the levels of total and proteinase K-resistant a-Syn in samples of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Twenty-one individuals with PD at various disease stages and 15 healthy controls, with similar demographic features, were recruited to this study. a-Syn levels were determined by their biochemical property to bind phospholipids, using a phospholipid-ELISA assay. A significantly lower ratio of total-to-proteinase K-resistant a-Syn levels was detected in PD patients than in the healthy control group. However, there was considerable overlap between the two groups. Suggesting a need for additional markers to be tested in combination with a-Syn levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence for an association between RBCs-expressed a-Syn and pathogenic mechanisms involved in PD.

26066178|t|Ice nucleation on carbon surface supports the classical theory for heterogeneous nucleation.
26066178|a|UNASSIGNED: The prevalence of heterogeneous nucleation in nature was explained qualitatively by the classical theory for heterogeneous nucleation established over more than 60 years ago, but the quantitative validity and the key conclusions of the theory have remained unconfirmed. Employing the forward flux sampling method and the coarse-grained water model (mW), we explicitly computed the heterogeneous ice nucleation rates in the supercooled water on a graphitic surface at various temperatures. The independently calculated ice nucleation rates were found to fit well according to the classical theory for heterogeneous nucleation. The fitting procedure further yields the estimate of the potency factor, which measures the ratio of the heterogeneous nucleation barrier to the homogeneous nucleation barrier. Remarkably, the estimated potency factor agrees quantitatively with the volumetric ratio of the critical nuclei between the heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation. Our numerical study thus provides a strong support to the quantitative power of the theory and allows understanding ice nucleation behaviors under the most relevant freezing conditions.

26068716|t|Indoxyl sulfate suppresses hepatic fetuin-A expression via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in HepG2 cells.
26068716|a|BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A is a liver-derived circulating protein that has potent calcification-inhibitory activity. Uraemic patients exhibit decreased serum fetuin-A levels, increased vascular calcification and elevated cardiovascular mortality. Because the mechanisms for fetuin-A deficiency are unknown, we hypothesized that some uraemic toxins suppressed hepatic fetuin-A production, which resulted in accelerated vascular calcification and poor outcome. Among these potential candidates, indoxyl sulfate (IS) has highly toxic properties. METHODS: We examined the direct effects of IS on hepatic fetuin-A expression using the human hepatoma HepG2 cell line. RESULTS: IS, but not p-cresyl sulfate, suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of fetuin-A in a dose- and time-dependent manner. As reported previously, IS stimulated p38 MAPK phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, although the knockdown of p38 and inhibition of ROS generation had no effect on IS-induced fetuin-A suppression. Then, because IS is a potent endogenous ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), we assessed whether IS suppresses fetuin-A production via AhR. The knockdown of AhR prevented IS-induced fetuin-A suppression. However, some attention should be paid to no effect of IS on fetuin-A expression in mouse and human primary cultured hepatocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that IS could suppress hepatic fetuin-A expression by activating AhR, suggesting a relationship between uraemia and fetuin-A deficiency.

26066372|t|Effect of Fasting on the Size of Lymphangioleiomyomas in Patients with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
26066372|a|Background.: Lymphangioleiomyomas occur in 38 % of patients with sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and may cause pain and increased abdominal girth, mimicking the presence of a malignancy. Lymphatic involvement in LAM is closely associated with elevated serum levels of vascular endothelium growth factor-D (VEGF-D). Since lymphangioleiomyomas undergo diurnal variation in volume, we hypothesized that the ingestion of food during day time, by increasing chyle formation and lymphatic flow, is the cause of an increase in lymphangioleiomyoma volume. Methods.: Patients had abdomino-pelvic sonograms and blood drawn for measurement of serum VEGF-D under non-fasting (day 1) and fasting (day 2) conditions. The size of the lymphangioleiomyomas was determined by a radiologist who was blinded to the subjects' status. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine whether the non-fasting tumor size was different from the fasting tumor size. Results.: Thirty-five women were studied (age=45.2  8.5 years, FEV1= 82  25 % and DLCO 64  25 % predicted); images suitable for volume measurements were obtained in 30. Fasting decreased the tumor size by 20.7  39.3 cm3 (24  40 %), (p<0.001). Fasting VEGF-D levels (10,650  900 pg/ml) were not significantly different from non-fasting values (12,100  800 pg/ml) (p=0.56). Conclusions.: Lymphangioleiomyoma volume decreased during the fasting state. Conversely, a combination of food intake and decreased chyle flow through lymphatics partially obstructed by LAM cells, may account for increases in lymphangioleiomyomas size. Imaging studies performed under fasting conditions may help in determining whether an abdominal tumor is a result of LAM or a malignancy.

26069594|t|A Comprehensive Histological Assessment of Osteoarthritis Lesions in Mice.
26069594|a|OBJECTIVE: Accurate histological assessment of osteoarthritis (OA) is critical in studies evaluating the effects of interventions on disease severity. The purpose of the present study was to develop a histological grading scheme that comprehensively and quantitatively assesses changes in multiple tissues that are associated with OA of the stifle joint in mice. DESIGN: Two representative midcoronal sections from 158 stifle joints, including naturally occurring and surgically induced OA, were stained with H_E and Safranin-O stains. All slides were evaluated to characterize the changes present. A grading scheme that includes both measurements and semiquantitative scores was developed, and principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to the resulting data from the medial tibial plateaus. A subset of 30 tibial plateaus representing a wide range of severity was then evaluated by 4 observers. Reliability of the results was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Five factors were retained by PCA, accounting for 74% of the total variance. Interobserver and intraobserver reproducibilities for evaluations of articular cartilage and subchondral bone were acceptable. The articular cartilage integrity and chondrocyte viability factor scores were able to distinguish severe OA from normal, minimal, mild, and moderate disease. CONCLUSION: This newly developed grading scheme and resulting factors characterize a range of joint changes in mouse stifle joints that are associated with OA. Overall, the newly developed scheme is reliable and reproducible, characterizes changes in multiple tissues, and provides comprehensive information regarding a specific site in the stifle joint.

26070824|t|Epistaxis and its Management in a Tertiary Health Facility in Nigeria:A need for thorough Evaluation.
26070824|a|BACKGROUND: Epistaxis is one of the most common acute otorhinolaryngologic emergency disorders OBJECTIVE: To review the aetiological profile, management and outcome of epistaxis in a resource challenged environment in Nigeria Methods: A retrospective review of patients that were managed for epistaxis over a five year period RESULTS: A total of 88 patients with an incidence of 18/1000 consisting of 53 males M:F ratio 1.5:1. The age ranged from 2- 68 years and age group 0-10 years was the most affected 29 (33%). Majority 73.9% presented during hot, dry season. Larger proportion (60.2%) was due to Idiopathic cause followed by trauma (11.4%). Over 47% has systemic illnesses that were incidentally discovered. Anterior nasal packing was the most common treatment modality in 46 (52.3%) patients. Thirty three (37.5%) patients were admitted either due to severe anaemia necessitating blood transfusion or due to underline medical condition. Eight (9.1%) patients had blood transfusion. CONCLUSION: Epistaxis is a common otorhinolaryngologic emergency among the children and the young adult in Africa with highest prevalence during the dry season. A deliberate effort to find the cause of epistaxis is hereby advocated as poverty and ignorance usually prevent most of our patients with underlying medical condition to present until they are in critical emergency situation.

26101047|t|Increased Belching After Sleeve Gastrectomy.
26101047|a|INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is considered to be an effective procedure for patients with morbid obesity. Belching is frequently reported after this procedure, but it has not been well studied in the bariatric population. This study aims to assess the changes in belching before and after sleeve gastrectomy, as measured with impedance monitoring. METHODS: In a prospective study, patients underwent 24-h pH-impedance monitoring before and 3  months after LSG. Using this technique, belches can be identified. Preoperative and postoperative upper gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed using the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ). RESULTS: Fifteen patients (1 M/14 F, mean age 42.2        11.0  years, mean weight 134.5        21.1  kg, mean BMI 46.4        6.0  kg/m(2)) participated in this study. Belching occurred significantly more often after LSG, with an increase in symptom score from 2.9        2.6 before to 5.3        3.5 3  months after LSG (p   =   0.04). The total number of gastric belches increased from 29.7        11.7 before to 59.5        38.3/24  h 3  months after LSG (p   =   0.03). The total number of supragastric belches did not change after LSG. The number of swallows decreased from 746.9        302.4 before to 555.7        172.5 3  months after the procedure (p   =   0.03). The number of air swallows tended to decrease (p   =   0.08). Esophageal acid exposure increased significantly, from 3.7        2.9  % before to 12.6        10.5  % after LSG (p   =   0.01). CONCLUSION: Subjectively (as reported by patients) and objectively (as measured by impedance monitoring), an increase in gastric belches is seen after LSG, while the number of (air) swallows tends to decrease after the procedure and the incidence of supragastric belches remains constant. The altered anatomy as well as increased gastroesophageal reflux after LSG may play a role in the increase of belching.

26100605|t|Linked genetic variants on chromosome 10 control ear morphology and body mass among dog breeds.
26100605|a|BACKGROUND: The domestic dog is a rich resource for mapping the genetic components of phenotypic variation due to its unique population history involving strong artificial selection. Genome-wide association studies have revealed a number of chromosomal regions where genetic variation associates with morphological characters that typify dog breeds. A region on chromosome 10 is among those with the highest levels of genetic differentiation between dog breeds and is associated with body mass and ear morphology, a common motif of animal domestication. We characterised variation in this region to uncover haplotype structure and identify candidate functional variants. RESULTS: We first identified SNPs that strongly associate with body mass and ear type by comparing sequence variation in a 3  Mb region between 19 breeds with a variety of phenotypes. We next genotyped a subset of 123 candidate SNPs in 288 samples from 46 breeds to identify the variants most highly associated with phenotype and infer haplotype structure. A cluster of SNPs that associate strongly with the drop ear phenotype is located within a narrow interval downstream of the gene MSRB3, which is involved in human hearing. These SNPs are in strong genetic linkage with another set of variants that correlate with body mass within the gene HMGA2, which affects human height. In addition we find evidence that this region has been under selection during dog domestication, and identify a cluster of SNPs within MSRB3 that are highly differentiated between dogs and wolves. CONCLUSIONS: We characterise genetically linked variants that potentially influence ear type and body mass in dog breeds, both key traits that have been modified by selective breeding that may also be important for domestication. The finding that variants on long haplotypes have effects on more than one trait suggests that genetic linkage can be an important determinant of the phenotypic response to selection in domestic animals.

26101356|t|Antibiotic Choice for Children Hospitalized With Pneumonia and Adherence to National Guidelines.
26101356|a|INTRODUCTION: The 2011 national guidelines for the management of childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) recommended narrow-spectrum antibiotics (eg, ampicillin) for most children hospitalized with CAP. We assessed the impact of these guidelines on antibiotic prescribing at 3 children's hospitals. METHODS: Children hospitalized with clinical and radiographic CAP were enrolled from January 1, 2010, through June 30, 2012, at 3 hospitals in Tennessee and Utah as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community study. Antibiotic selection was determined by the treating provider. The impact of the guidelines and hospital-level implementation efforts was determined by assessing the monthly percentage of enrolled children receiving third-generation cephalosporins or penicillin/ampicillin. Segmented linear regression was used to compare observed antibiotic selection in the postguideline period with expected antibiotic use projected from preguideline months. RESULTS: Overall, 2121 children were included. During the preguideline period, 52.8% (interquartile range 47.8-56.6) of children with CAP received third-generation cephalosporins, whereas 2.7% (2.1, 7.0) received penicillin/ampicillin. By 9 months postguidelines, third-generation cephalosporin use declined (absolute difference -12.4% [95% confidence interval -19.8% to -5.1%]), whereas penicillin/ampicillin use increased (absolute difference 11.3% [4.3%-18.3%]). The most substantial changes were noted at those institutions that implemented guideline-related dissemination activities. CONCLUSIONS: After publication of national guidelines, third-generation cephalosporin use declined and penicillin/ampicillin use increased among children hospitalized with CAP. Changes were more apparent among those institutions that proactively disseminated the guidelines, suggesting that targeted, hospital-based efforts are important for timely implementation of guideline recommendations.

26100395|t|Characterization of Novel Fusaricidins Produced by Paenibacillus polymyxa-M1 Using MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry.
26100395|a|UNASSIGNED: Paenibacillus polymyxa-M1 is a potent producer of bioactive compounds, such as lipopeptides, polyketides, and lantibiotics of biotechnological and medical interest. Genome sequencing revealed nine gene clusters for nonribosomal biosynthesis of such agents. Here we report on the investigation of the fusaricidins, a complex of cyclic lipopeptides containing 15-guanidino-3-hydroxypentadecanoic acid (GHPD) as fatty acid component by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). More than 20 variants of these compounds were detected and characterized in detail. Mass spectrometric sequence analysis was performed by MALDI-LIFT-TOF/TOF fragment analysis. The obtained product ion spectra show a specific processing in the fatty acid part. GHPD is cleaved between the a- and   -position yielding two fragments a and b, one bearing the end-standing guanidine group and another one comprising the residual two C-atoms of GHPD with the attached peptide moiety. The complete sequence of all fusaricidins was derived from sets of bn- and yn-ions. The fusaricidin complex can be divided into four lipopeptide families, three of them showing variations of the amino acid in position 3, Val or Ile for the first and Tyr or Phe for families 2 and 3, respectively. A collection of novel fusaricidins was detected differing from those of families 1-3 by an additional residue of 71  Da (family 4). LIFT-TOF/TOF fragment spectra of these species imply that in their peptide moiety, an Ala-residue is attached by an ester bond to the free hydroxyl group of Thr4. More than 10 novel fusaricidins were characterized mass spectrometrically. Graphical Abstract    .

26106211|t|Tumour-associated antigens in systemic sclerosis patients with interstitial lung disease: association with lung involvement and cancer risk.
26106211|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the serum levels of tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) in patients with SSc and interstitial lung disease (ILD) and to define whether their levels mirror the severity and the progression of lung damage. METHODS: Data from 80 SSc patients with ILD were collected at baseline and after 2 years as well as from 40 SSc controls without ILD. The occurrence of any malignancy was recorded. RESULTS: At baseline, an increase of at least one TAA was present in 35 SSc patients with ILD compared with 6 SSc patients without ILD (P < 0.0001); this was associated with lower forced vital capacity (FVC) and higher interstitial and alveolar scores. Levels of carbohydrate antigen 15-3 and carcinoembryonic antigen inversely correlated with FVC and directly correlated with alveolar and interstitial scores and their levels were higher in patients who presented a progression of lung damage after 2 years. During 4 years of follow-up, a malignancy was detected in seven patients who already had an increase of at least one TAA. Values of TAAs increased over time in patients who developed cancer, while their trend remained stable in the others. At multivariate analysis, to have three or more TAAs emerged as a strong independent predictor of the development of malignancies [relative risk 24.1 (95% CI 1.8, 315.0), P = 0.02]. CONCLUSION: TAAs can be elevated in the sera of SSc patients and correlate with the degree of lung damage, suggesting a role as severity biomarkers. Close follow-up is necessary in SSc patients because of the increased cancer risk overall in patients with increased TAAs.

26104196|t|Plasmid Replication Control by Antisense RNAs.
26104196|a|Plasmids are selfish genetic elements that normally constitute a burden for the bacterial host cell. This burden is expected to favor plasmid loss. Therefore, plasmids have evolved mechanisms to control their replication and ensure their stable maintenance. Replication control can be either mediated by iterons or by antisense RNAs. Antisense RNAs work through a negative control circuit. They are constitutively synthesized and metabolically unstable. They act both as a measuring device and a regulator, and regulation occurs by inhibition. Increased plasmid copy numbers lead to increasing antisense-RNA concentrations, which, in turn, result in the inhibition of a function essential for replication. On the other hand, decreased plasmid copy numbers entail decreasing concentrations of the inhibiting antisense RNA, thereby increasing the replication frequency. Inhibition is achieved by a variety of mechanisms, which are discussed in detail. The most trivial case is the inhibition of translation of an essential replication initiator protein (Rep) by blockage of the rep-ribosome binding site. Alternatively, ribosome binding to a leader peptide mRNA whose translation is required for efficient Rep translation can be prevented by antisense-RNA binding. In 2004, translational attenuation was discovered. Antisense-RNA-mediated transcriptional attenuation is another mechanism that has, so far, only been detected in plasmids of Gram-positive bacteria. ColE1, a plasmid that does not need a plasmid-encoded replication initiator protein, uses the inhibition of primer formation. In other cases, antisense RNAs inhibit the formation of an activator pseudoknot that is required for efficient Rep translation.

26109847|t|Efficiency and safety of subconjunctival injection of anti-VEGF agent - bevacizumab - in treating dry eye.
26109847|a|PURPOSE: Dry eye is a chronic inflammatory ocular surface disease with high prevalence. The current therapies for dry eye remain to be unspecific and notcomprehensive. This study aims to explore safety and efficacy of a novel treatment - subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab - in dry eye patients. METHODS: Sixty-four eyes of 32 dry eye patients received subconjunctival injection of 100  L 25 mg/mL bevacizumab. Dry eye symptoms, signs (corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, conjunctival vascularity, corneal staining, tear break-up time, Marx line score, and blood pressure), and conjunctival impression cytology were evaluated 3 days before and 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after injection. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in dry eye symptoms, tear break-up time, and conjunctival vascularization area at all the visits after injection compared to the baseline (P<0.05). The density of the goblet cell increased significantly at 1 month and 3 months after injection (P<0.05). There was no visual and systemic threat observed in any patient. CONCLUSION: Subconjunctival injection of 100  L 25 mg/mL bevacizumab is a safe and efficient treatment for ocular surface inflammation of dry eye disease.

26109467|a|Preclinical Research Given nuclear-power-plant incidents such as the 2011 Japanese Fukushima-Daiichi disaster, an urgent need for effective medicines to protect against and treat the harmful biological effects of radiation is evident. To address such a challenge, we describe potential strategies herein including mitochondrial and epigenetic-driven methods using lipoic and butyric acid ester conjugates of carnitine. The antioxidant and other therapeutically beneficial properties of this class of agents may protect against ionizing radiation and resultant mitochondrial dysfunction.

26105423|t|PP101. Preeclampsia and pregnancy induced hypertension and carotid artery atherosclerosis.
26105423|a|INTRODUCTION: Recent studies indicated preeclampsia (PE) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) as risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in young women. Women with a history of preeclampsia face double the risk of a heart disease during the 5-15years after pregnancy. We assessed the impact of these factors on endothelial function, atherosclerotic changes and lipid metabolism in young women with a history of preeclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine whether women with a history of preeclampsia more often show signs of atherosclerosis compared with control group METHODS: We analyzed serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-C and triglycerides (TG). Endothelium-dependent vasodilation and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) were evaluated in 18 patients with a history of PE, 16 with a history of PIH and 17 healthy controls (CN). Inter-group differences were calculated using Student's t-test. RESULTS: We found a worse lipid profile among women with PE and PIH. LDL-C was increased significantly in PE and PIH (PE: 3.17mmol/l [SD 0.50] and PIH: 3.37mmol/l [SD 0.48] vs CN: 2.83mmol/l [SD 0.35], p<0.05); TC and TG were higher in the PE and PIH groups, but not significantly (p>0.05). Compared to controls, endothelium-dependent vasodilation was significantly reduced in PE and PIH patients (10.5% [SD 4.3] and 8.8% [SD 3.1] vs 14.5% [SD 3.6], p<0.05). The mean combined CA-IMT was significantly higher in PE and PIH patients (0.66mm [SD 0.08] and 0.63mm [SD 0.09], respectively vs 0.52mm [SD 0.04]). CONCLUSION: We conclude that impaired endothelial vasoreactivity and increased CA-IMT are prevalent in women with a history of PE and PIH and are associated with traditional risk factors that strongly suggest that PE and PIH could be non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

26109400|t|Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review.
26109400|a|INTRODUCTION: Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) has been proposed for hypercapnic respiratory failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, to avoid intubation or reduce length of invasive ventilation. Balance of risks, efficacy, and benefits of ECCO2R in patients with COPD is unclear. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify all publications reporting use of ECCO2R in COPD. We looked at physiological and clinical efficacy. A favorable outcome was defined as prevention of intubation or successful extubation. Major and minor complications were compiled. RESULTS: We identified 3123 citations. Ten studies (87 patients), primarily case series, met inclusion criteria. ECCO2R prevented intubation in 65/70 (93  %) patients and assisted in the successful extubation of 9/17 (53  %) mechanically ventilated subjects. One case-control study matching to noninvasively ventilated controls reported lower intubation rates and hospital mortality with ECCO2R that trended toward significance. Physiological data comparing pre- to post-ECCO2R changes suggest improvements for pH (0.07-0.15 higher), PaCO2 (25  mmHg lower), and respiratory rate (7  breaths/min lower), but not PaO2/FiO2. Studies reported 11 major (eight bleeds requiring blood transfusion of 2  units, and three line-related complications, including one death related to retroperitoneal bleeding) and 30 minor complications (13 bleeds, five related to anticoagulation, and nine clotting-related device malfunctions resulting in two emergent intubations). CONCLUSION: The technique is still experimental and no randomized trial is available. Recognizing selection bias associated with case series, there still appears to be potential for benefit of ECCO2R in patients with COPD exacerbations. However, it is associated with frequent and potentially severe complications. Higher-quality studies are required to better elucidate this risk-benefit balance.

26110495|t|Response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation tests in preterm infants with transient hypothyroxinemia of prematurity.
26110495|a|OBJECTIVE: Whether hormone supplementation is necessary for infants with transient hypothyroxinemia of prematurity (THOP) remains controversial, and further analysis of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis of infants with THOP is necessary. STUDY DESIGN: Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation tests were performed at 2 weeks of age in 50 infants with a gestational age of 30 weeks or less, and the data were analyzed retrospectively. RESULT: Subjects were divided into three groups; group A consisted of euthyroid infants, group B consisted of infants with THOP and group C consisted of hypothyroid infants. The basal and peak thyroid-stimulating hormone level of group C in response to TRH stimulation tests was significantly higher than the others, but no differences were observed between groups A and B. CONCLUSION: The response of infants with THOP to the TRH stimulation test was not different from that of euthyroid infants, which suggested that their hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis was appropriately regulated in infants with THOP.Journal of Perinatology advance online publication, 25 June 2015; doi:10.1038/jp.2015.67.

26110716|t|Intravital imaging of hair follicle regeneration in the mouse.
26110716|a|UNASSIGNED: Hair follicles are mammalian skin organs that periodically and stereotypically regenerate from a small pool of stem cells. Hence, hair follicles are a widely studied model for stem cell biology and regeneration. This protocol describes the use of two-photon laser-scanning microscopy (TPLSM) to study hair regeneration within a living, uninjured mouse. TPLSM provides advantages over conventional approaches, including enabling time-resolved imaging of single hair follicle stem cells. Thus, it is possible to capture behaviors including apoptosis, proliferation and migration, and to revisit the same cells for in vivo lineage tracing. In addition, a wide range of fluorescent reporter mouse lines facilitates TPLSM in the skin. This protocol also describes TPLSM laser ablation, which can spatiotemporally manipulate specific cellular populations of the hair follicle or microenvironment to test their regenerative contributions. The preparation time is variable depending on the goals of the experiment, but it generally takes 30-60 min. Imaging time is dependent on the goals of the experiment. Together, these components of TPLSM can be used to develop a comprehensive understanding of hair regeneration during homeostasis and injury.

26111920|t|Investigating the performance and cost-effectiveness of the simple ultrasound-based rules compared to the risk of malignancy index in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer (SUBSONiC-study): protocol of a prospective multicenter cohort study in the Netherlands.
26111920|a|BACKGROUND: Estimating the risk of malignancy is essential in the management of adnexal masses. An accurate differential diagnosis between benign and malignant masses will reduce morbidity and costs due to unnecessary operations, and will improve referral to a gynecologic oncologist for specialized cancer care, which improves outcome and overall survival. The Risk of Malignancy Index is currently the most commonly used method in clinical practice, but has a relatively low diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 75-80  % and specificity 85-90  %). Recent reports show that other methods, such as simple ultrasound-based rules, subjective assessment and (Diffusion Weighted) Magnetic Resonance Imaging might be superior to the RMI in the pre-operative differentiation of adnexal masses. METHODS/DESIGN: A prospective multicenter cohort study will be performed in the south of The Netherlands. A total of 270 women diagnosed with at least one pelvic mass that is suspected to be of ovarian origin who will undergo surgery, will be enrolled. We will apply the Risk of Malignancy Index with a cut-off value of 200 and a two-step triage test consisting of simple ultrasound-based rules supplemented -if necessary- with either subjective assessment by an expert sonographer or Magnetic Resonance Imaging with diffusion weighted sequences, to characterize the adnexal masses. The histological diagnosis will be the reference standard. Diagnostic performances will be expressed as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and likelihood ratios. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that this two-step triage test, including the simple ultrasound-based rules, will have better diagnostic accuracy than the Risk of Malignancy Index and therefore will improve the management of women with adnexal masses. Furthermore, we expect this two-step test to be more cost-effective. If the hypothesis is confirmed, the results of this study could have major effects on current guidelines and implementation of the triage test in daily clinical practice could be a possibility. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: registration number NCT02218502.

26114969|t|Association of Gestational Age at Birth with Reasons for Subsequent Hospitalisation: 18 Years of Follow-Up in a Western Australian Population Study.
26114969|a|BACKGROUND: Preterm infants are at a higher risk of hospitalisation following discharge from the hospital after birth. The reasons for rehospitalisation and the association with gestational age are not well understood. METHODS: This was a retrospective birth cohort study of all live, singleton infants born in Western Australia between 1st January 1980 and 31st December 2010, followed to 18 years of age. Risks of rehospitalisation following birth discharge by principal diagnoses were compared for gestational age categories (<32, 32-33, 34-36, 37-38 weeks) and term births (39-41weeks). Causes of hospitalisations at various gestational age categories were identified using ICD-based discharge diagnostic codes. RESULTS: Risk of rehospitalisation was inversely correlated with gestational age. Growth-related concerns were the main causes for rehospitalisation in the neonatal period (<1 month of age) for all gestational ages. Infection was the most common reason for hospitalisation from 29 days to 1 year of age, and up to 5 years of age. Injury-related hospitalisations increased in prevalence from 5 years to 18 years of age. Risk of rehospitalisation was higher for all preterm infants for most causes. CONCLUSIONS: The highest risks of rehospitalisation were for infection related causes for most GA categories. Compared with full term born infants, those born at shorter GA remain vulnerable to subsequent hospitalisation for a variety of causes up until 18 years of age.

26112004|t|Phase I/II Study of Weekly Oraxol for the Second-Line Treatment of Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Gastric Cancer.
26112004|a|LESSONS LEARNED: Oraxol, a novel oral formulation of paclitaxel, displayed modest efficacy as second-line chemotherapy for gastric cancer.Considering its favorable toxicity profiles, further studies are warranted in various solid tumors including gastric cancer. BACKGROUND: Oraxol consists of paclitaxel and HM30181A, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, to increase the oral bioavailability of paclitaxel. This phase I/II study (HM-OXL-201) was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of Oraxol. In addition, we investigated the efficacy and safety of Oraxol as second-line chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: In the phase I component, paclitaxel was orally administered at escalating doses (90, 120, or 150 mg/m(2) per day) with a fixed dose (15 mg/day) of HM30181A. Oraxol was administrated 6 times per cycle (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16) every 4 weeks. In the phase II component, the efficacy and safety of Oraxol were evaluated. RESULTS: In the phase I component, the MTD could not be determined. Based on toxicity and pharmacokinetic data, the RP2D of oral paclitaxel was determined to be 150 mg/m(2). In the phase II component, 4 of 43 patients (9.3%) achieved partial responses. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 2.6 and 10.7 months, respectively. Toxicity profiles were favorable, and the most common drug-related adverse events (grade >= 3) were neutropenia and diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Oraxol exhibited modest efficacy and favorable toxicity profiles as second-line chemotherapy for GC.

26114184|t|Premalignant and malignant lesions of the heterotopic pancreas in the esophagus: a case report and review of the literature.
26114184|a|Heterotopic pancreas is a congenital pathology of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly rare in the esophagus. Both symptomatology and findings during preoperative examinations are non-specific and therefore do not often lead to an accurate diagnosis, which is usually revealed only by histopathological assessment of a resected specimen. We report an unusual case of a patient suffering from severe dysphagia caused by heterotopic pancreas in the distal esophagus with chronic inflammation and foci of premalignant changes. This article also reviews 14 adult cases of heterotopic pancreas in the esophagus previously reported in the literature, with the aim of determining the clinical features of this disease and possible complications including rare premalignant lesions and malignant transformation. Especially with regard to those complications, we suggest that both symptomatic and incidentally found asymptomatic lesions should be resected.

26114147|t|Hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) as a Source of Ectoparasites in Urban-suburban Areas of Northwest of Iran.
26114147|a|BACKGROUND: Hedgehogs are small, nocturnal mammals which become popular in the world and have important role in transmission of zoonotic agents. Thus, the present study aimed to survey ectoparasite infestation from April 2010 to December 2011 in urban and suburban parts of Urmia and Tabriz Cities, Northwest of Iran. METHODS: A total number of 84 hedgehogs (40 females and 44 males) were examined. They have been carefully inspected for ectoparasites and collected arthropods were stored in 70% ethanol solution. The identification of arthropods was carried out using morphological diagnostic keys. RESULTS: The occurrence of ticks on hedgehogs was 23 (67.7%) with Rhipicephalus turanicus in Urmia and 11 (22%) as well as 1(2%) with Rh. turanicus and Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum in Tabriz, respectively. One flea species, Archaeopsylla erinacei, was found with prevalence of 19 (55.9%) and 27 (54%) in Urmia and Tabriz Cities, respectively. Prevalence of infestation with Rh. turanicus and A. erinacei were not different (P> 0.05) between sexes of hedgehogs in two study areas. Highest prevalence of tick and flea infestation was in June in Urmia, whereas it was observed in August in Tabriz. Both tick and flea parasitizing hedgehogs showed seasonal difference in prevalence (P< 0.05) in Urmia, but it was not detected in Tabriz (P> 0.05). CONCLUSION: The result showed the high occurrence of ectoparasites in hedgehog population and according to the zoonotic potential of these animals as vector of some agents further studies are needed to investigate in different parts of Iran.

26114508|t|Comparison of Autogenous and Alloplastic Cranioplasty Materials Following Impact Testing.
26114508|a|UNASSIGNED: Alloplastic materials are often used when significant defects exist. Benefits include no donor site morbidity, relative ease of use, limitless supply, and predictable durability. Depending on the type of alloplast, limitations include a persistent risk of extrusion and infection. Of particular interest in relation to cranioplasties is the ability of the material to provide neuroprotection. The integrity and neuroprotective properties of autologous bone flaps, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and high-density porous polyethylene (PP) were evaluated following impact testing. Three groups of New Zealand white rabbits (N=4) underwent a cranioplasty with either a bone flap, PMMA, or PP. In the control group (N=4), the animals had no cranioplasty. At the end of the eighth week, an impact was delivered to the center of each cranioplasty. At necropsy each cranium and brain was evaluated grossly and histologically. There was a statistical significant difference among groups for the severity of the hemorrhage (P=0.022) and the grade of cranioplasty disruption (P=0.0045). Autologous bone was found to be the weakest of the materials tested. In this group severe injury resulted at much lower energy levels than was observed in the control, PMMA, or PP groups. Both PMMA and PP were resistant to fracture and disruption. PMMA provided the greatest neuroprotection, followed by PP. Autologous bone provided the least protection with cranioplasty disruption and severe brain injury occurring in every patient. Brain injury patterns correlated with the degree of cranioplasty disruption regardless of the cranioplasty material. Regardless of the energy of impact, lack of dislodgement generally resulted in no obvious brain injury.

26002805|t|A randomized noninferiority crossover controlled trial of the functional performance and safety of new female condoms: an evaluation of the Velvet, Cupid2, and FC2.
26002805|a|OBJECTIVES: New designs of female condoms have been developed to lower cost and/or improve acceptability. To secure regulatory approvals, clinical studies are required to verify performance. We aimed to assess the functional performance and safety of two new female condom types - Velvet and Cupid2 female condom - against the existing FC2 female condom. STUDY DESIGN: This was a three-period crossover, randomized noninferiority clinical trial with 300 women randomized to condom-type order in one South African site. Primary end points were total clinical failure and total female condom failure. Noninferiority of component modes, clinical breakage, nonclinical breakage, slippage, misdirection and invagination were also determined. Safety data were also assessed for each female condom. Participants were asked to use five of each female condom type and to collect information on use in a condom diary at home and were interviewed after use of each type. Frequencies and percentages were calculated by condom type for each failure mode, and differences in performance of the three female condoms using FC2 as reference, with 95% confidence intervals, were estimated using generalized estimating equation models. RESULTS: A total of 282 (94%) participants completed follow-up, using at least one condom of each type. Total clinical failure (clinical breakage, invagination, misdirection, slippage) was <5% for all female condoms: FC2 (4.50%), Cupid2 (4.79%) and Velvet (3.93%). Noninferiority was demonstrated for all condom failure modes for the two new female condoms with respect to FC2, within the margin of 3% difference in mean failure, at the 5% significance level. CONCLUSION: Noninferiority for the two new female condoms was demonstrated with respect to the marketed FC2. These data are used to support manufacturer dossiers for World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) prequalification. IMPLICATIONS: Data from this study have been submitted to WHO/UNFPA and will contribute to the prequalification submission requirements for the Cupid2 and Velvet female condoms.

26114654|t|Simultaneous determination of intracellular UDP-sugars in hyaluronic acid-producing Streptococcus zooepidemicus.
26114654|a|UNASSIGNED: Two chromatographic methods for the quantitative analysis of uridine diphosphate (UDP) sugars involved in hyaluronan pathway of Streptococcus zooepidemicus (SEZ) were developed and compared. The sample preparation protocol using centrifugation and extraction in hot ethanol was employed prior to the analyses. Separation was achieved using an anion exchange Spherisorb SAX column or a Shodex QA-825 column connected with a photodiode array (PDA) detector. To increase the throughput of the chromatography method employing the Spherisorb SAX column, the solid phase extraction (SPE) procedure was introduced. Method validation results displayed that limits of detection (LODs) of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA) calculated according to QC Expert software were in the low micromolar range and the coefficient of correlation (R(2)) was above 0.997. However, the analytical technique using the Spherisorb SAX column resulted in 80-90% recoveries and low LODs ( <=6.19 M), the Shodex QA-825 column showed better long-term stability and reproducible chromatographic properties (RSD <=5.60%). The Shodex QA-825 column was successfully used to monitor UDP-sugar levels during the growth rate of SEZ cells.

26115424|t|Analysis of Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal CellsUsed for Acute Graft Versus Host Disease Prophylaxis.
26115424|a|BACKGROUND: Multipotent mesenchymalstromal cells (MSCs) are used for prophylaxis of acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) after allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Not all samples of MSC are efficient for aGvHD prevention. The suitabilityof MSCsfor aGvHDprophylaxiswas studied. METHODS: MSCs werederived from the bone marrow (BM) of HCT donor and cultivated for no more than 3 passages.The characteristics of donor BM samples including colony forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) concentration, growth parameters of MSCs and the relative expression levels (REL) of different geneswere analyzed. MSCs were injected intravenously precisely at the moment of blood cell reconstitution. RESULTS: MSCsinfusion induced a significant 3-fold decrease in aGvHD development and improved overall survival compared with the standard prophylaxis group. In ineffective MSC samples (9.4%),asignificant decrease in total cell production and the REL of CSF1, FGFR1 and PDGFRB were observed.In all studied BM samples, the cumulative MSC production and CFU-F concentrations decreased with age.The expression levels of FGFR2, PPARG and VEGF differed by age. CONCLUSIONS: A universal single indicator for the prediction of MSC eligibility for aGvHD prophylaxis was not identified. A multiparametermathematical modelfor selectingMSCsampleseffectivefor the prevention ofaGvHDwas proposed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

26054662|t|Depolymerization of polysaccharides from Opuntia ficus indica: Antioxidant and antiglycated activities.
26054662|a|UNASSIGNED: The extraction, purification and degradation of polysaccharides from Opuntia ficus indica cladodes, as well as the evaluation of their antioxidant and antiglycated activities in vitro were investigated. The optimization of the extraction showed that extraction by ultrasound at 40  C presented the best carbohydrates yield. The degradation of the extracted polysaccharides was achieved by free radical depolymerization with H2O2 in the presence of copper(II) acetate for various reaction times. Sugar contents were determined by colorimetric assays. The macromolecular characteristics of the different isolated and degraded carbohydrates were carried by size exclusion chromatography (SEC/MALS/VD/DRI). These experiments showed that all samples are polysaccharides, which are probably pectins and that molecular weight (Mw) has decreased from 6,800,000 to 14,000g/mol after 3h of depolymerization without changing the structure. Preliminary antioxidant and antiglycated tests indicated that degraded polysaccharides for 2 and 3h showed even better antioxidant and antiglycated activities.

26114319|t|Sequencing and analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome in Anopheles culicifacies species B (Diptera: Culicidae).
26114319|a|UNASSIGNED: The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Anopheles culicifacial species B was sequenced in this study. The length of the mitochondrial genome is 15   330   bp, which contains 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA genes, two rRNA genes, and a non-coding control region. The gene order and the gene composition are consistent with those previously reported for other mosquito species. The initiation codon of the PCGs complies with the ATN rule except for COI using TCG and ND5 using GTG as a start codon, and the termination codon is TAA or imcomplete, an only T. The total base composition is 40.4% A, 38.1% T, 12.4% C, and 9.1% G. The phylogenetic tree based on the sequences of 13 protein-coding genes showed that these species were classified into two clades, corresponding to the subgenus Cellia and subgenus Nyssorhynchus. An. culicifacies species B of Myzomyia Series was clustered with An. gambiae of Pyretophorus Series with a high bootstrap value of 100%. The complete mitogenome data can provide a basis for molecular identification and phylogenetic studies of mosquito species.

26113151|t|Photovoltaic properties of multilayered quantum dot/quantum rod-sensitized TiO2 solar cells fabricated by SILAR and electrophoresis.
26113151|a|UNASSIGNED: A multilayered semiconductor sensitizer structure composed of three differently sized CdSe quantum rods (QRs), labeled as Q530, Q575, Q590, were prepared and deposited on the surface of mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) for photovoltaic applications. By varying the arrangement of layers as well as the time of EPD, the photoconversion efficiency was improved from 2.0% with the single layer of CdSe QRs (TiO2/Q590/ZnS) to 2.9% for multilayers (TiO2/Q590Q575/ZnS). The optimal EPD time was shorter for the multilayered structures. The effect of CdS quantum dots (QDs) deposited by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) was also investigated. The addition of CdS QDs resulted in the enhancement of efficiency to 4.1% for the configuration (TiO2/CdS/Q590Q575/ZnS), due to increased photocurrent and photovoltage. Based on detailed structural, optical, and photoelectrical studies, the increased photocurrent is attributed to broadened light absorption while the increased voltage is due to a shift in the relevant energy levels.

26106279|t|Formulation and characterization of 5-Fluorouracil enteric coated nanoparticles for sustained and localized release in treating colorectal cancer.
26106279|a|5-Fluorouracil is used in the treatment of colorectal cancer along with oxaliplatin as first line treatment, but it is having lack of site specificity and poor therapeutic effect. Also toxic effects to healthy cells and unavailability of major proportion of drug at the colon region remain as limitations. Toxic effects prevention and drug localization at colon area was achieved by preparing enteric-coated chitosan polymeric nanoparticles as it can be delivered directly to large bowel. Enteric coating helps in preventing the drug degradation at gastric pH. So the main objective was to prepare chitosan polymeric nanoparticles by solvent evaporation emulsification method by using different ratios of polymer (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4). Optimized polymer ratio was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), entrapment efficiency and particle size and further subjected to enteric coating. In vitro drug release studies were done using dialysis bag technique using simulated fluids at various pH (1.2, 4.5, 7.5, 7.0) to mimic the GIT tract. 5-FU nanoparticles with drug: polymer ratio of 1:2 and 1:3 has shown better particle size (149      1.28  nm and 138      1.01  nm respectively), entrapment efficiency (48.12      0.08% and 69.18      1.89 respectively). 5-FU E1 has shown better drug release after 4  h and has shown 82% drug release till 24  h in a sustained manner comparable to the non-enteric coated tablets, which released more than 50% of the drug before entering the colon region. So we can conclude that nanoparticles prepared by this method using the same polymer with the optimized ratio can represent as potential drug delivery approach for effective delivery of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to the colorectal tumors.

26117693|t|Comparison of Single Voxel Brain MRS AT 3T and 7T Using 32-Channel Head Coils.
26117693|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of three different regions of the human brain between 3 and 7 Tesla, using the same subjects and closely matched methodology at both field strengths. METHODS: A semi-LASER (sLASER) pulse sequence with TE 32 ms was used to acquire metabolite spectrum along with the water reference at 3T and 7T using similar experimental parameters and hardware at both field strengths (n=4 per region and field). Spectra were analyzed in LCModel using a simulated basis set. RESULTS: Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at 7T was higher compared to 3T and linewidths (in ppm) at both field strengths were comparable in ppm scale. Of the 13 metabolites reported in the paper, most metabolites were measured with higher precision at 7T in all three regions. CONCLUSION: The study confirms gains in SNR and measurement precision at 7T in all three representative brain regions using the sLASER pulse sequence coupled with a 32-channel phased-array head coil.

26116334|t|Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae carriers in acute care hospitals and postacute-care facilities: The effect of organizational culture on staff attitudes, knowledge, practices, and infection acquisition rates.
26116334|a|BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) carriers are frequently transferred between acute care hospitals (ACHs) and postacute-care facilities (PACFs). Compliance of health care workers with infection prevention guidelines in both care settings may be influenced by the institution's organizational culture. OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between organizational culture and health care workers' attitudes, knowledge, practices, and CRE acquisition rate and to identify differences between different care settings and health care workers' sectors. METHODS: Cross-sectional descriptive design. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to a sample of 420 health care workers from 1 ACH and 1 PACF belonging to the same health maintenance organization located in central Israel. RESULTS: The organizational culture factor known as staff engagement was positively correlated with infection prevention attitudes and compliance with contact precaution protocols and negatively correlated with CRE acquisition rate. In the 2 care settings, health care workers' attitudes, knowledge, and practices were found to be similar, but CRE acquisition rate was lower in PACFs. Compliance with contact precaution protocols by physicians was lower than compliance reported by other health care workers. Auxiliary staff reported lower knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: In a setting of endemic CRE where a multifaceted intervention is already being implemented, organizational culture variables can predict health care workers' attitudes, knowledge, and practices and in turn can affect CRE acquisition rates.

26004952|t|Does the Technique of Carotid Endarterectomy Determine Postoperative Hypertension?
26004952|a|BACKGROUND: Hypertension (HT) after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a risk factor for postoperative myocardial infarction, stroke, and neck hematoma. We compared the incidence of postoperative HT within the week after eversion CEA (e-CEA) and patch closure CEA (p-CEA). Postoperative HT was defined as a systolic blood pressure (sBP)  >=   160  mm Hg and/or the need for postoperative vasodilatators. The aim of our study was to determine if the technique of CEA had an effect on postoperative HT. METHODS: Between January 2010 and June 2011, we prospectively reviewed 560 consecutive endarterectomies (340 p-CEAs and 220 e-CEAs) performed in 443 patients under general anesthesia. All had >70% stenoses, 119 were symptomatic, and 441 asymptomatic. We compared preoperative, peroperative, and postoperative sBP and diastolic blood pressure, carotid sinus nerve block, postoperative intravenous and oral antihypertensive medications, neurologic and cardiac complications, and mortality. RESULTS: The e-CEA group had a higher incidence of women (36.4% vs. 21.8%, P  =  0.0002) and HT (85.0% vs. 78.2%, P  =  0.04). The e-CEAs had a significantly higher incidence of carotid sinus nerve block (93.6% vs. 15.6%, P  <  0.0001). The incidence of postoperative HT was not significantly different between the 2 groups (75.9% in the e-CEA group versus 68.5% in the p-CEA group, P  =  0.06). The average postoperative sBP between postoperative hour (H) 2 and H12 was significantly higher in the e-CEA group but  <160  mm Hg. The sBP dropped between H2 and H6, and this decrease was greater in the p-CEA group (30% vs. 15% in the e-CEA group). The need for postoperative antihypertensive medication was not different between the 2 groups. One independent risk factor of postoperative HT was identified: history of HT. The rate of postoperative complications was not significantly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The e-CEA technique is not a risk factor and does not have an effect on postoperative HT. The postoperative sBP was more stable in this group. Eversion carotid endarterectomy has been considered, in the literature, as a risk factor of postoperative hypertension. We conducted a large prospective and comparative study of the endarterectomy technique by eversion and with conventional patch closure. The primary end point was the blood pressure value and the administration of antihypertensive treatment. Our study shows that postoperative hypertension after carotid endarterectomy is not related to the surgical technique. Changes in blood pressure after carotid endarterectomy by eversion are lower than those observed after conventional endarterectomy with patch closure. This technique prevents the occurrence of possible hypotension occurrence, which can be the cause of perioperative complications.

26116168|t|Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in elderly patients (>= 70years) with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: A French Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy retrospective study.
26116168|a|INTRODUCTION: Limited data is available on the feasibility of high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) in elderly patients over 70years of age with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the setting of the Soci  t   Fran  aise de Greffe de Moelle et de Th  rapie Cellulaire (SFGM-TC) group, we retrospectively analyzed 81 consecutive patients with NHL over 70years of age who received AHSCT. RESULTS: The median age at AHSCT was 72.3years [70-80]. Patients' were diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=40), follicular lymphoma (n=16), mantle cell lymphoma (n=15), T-cell lymphoma (n=5), and other (n=5). Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) was 0 in 73% of patients. Main conditionings were BEAM (Carmustine-Etoposide-Cytarabine-Melphalan, n=61) and melphalan alone (n=14). Median delays to reach 0.5*10(9)/L neutrophils and 20*10(9)/L platelets were of 12 [9-76] days and 12 [0-143] days, respectively. One hundred day and one year cumulative incidence of NRM was 5.4% and 8.5%, respectively. The main cause of death remains relapse. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study revealed that AHSCT seemed to be acceptable in patients over 70years of age with NHL. Patient age is not a limiting factor if clinical condition is adequate.

26005191|t|Phenylhydrazine administration accelerates the development of experimental cerebral malaria.
26005191|a|UNASSIGNED: Phenylhydrazine (PHZ) treatment is generally used to enhance parasitemia in infected mice models. Transient reticulocytosis is commonly observed in iron-deficient anemic hosts after treatment with iron supplementation, and is also associated with short-term hemolysis caused by PHZ treatment. In this study, we investigated the relationship between reticulocytosis and cerebral malaria (CM) in a murine model induced by PHZ administration before Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection. Mortality and parasitemia were checked daily. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and IL-10 were quantified by ELISA. The expression of CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL5, and CXCR3 mRNAs was determined by real-time PCR. Brain sequestration of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and populations of splenic Th1 CD4(+) T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), CD11b(+) Gr1(+) cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) were assessed by FACS. PHZ administration dramatically increased parasitemia from day 3 to day 5 post infection (p.i.) compared with the untreated control infected mice group; also, CM developed at day 5 p.i., compared with day 7 p.i. in untreated control infected mice, as well as significantly decreased blood-brain barrier function (P   <   0.001). PHZ administration during PbA infection significantly increased the expression of CXCL9 (P   <0.05) and VCAM-1 (P   <0.001) in the brain, increased the expression of CXCL10, CCL5 and CXCR3, and significantly increased the recruitment of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (P   <0.001 and P   <0.01, respectively) as well as CD11b(+) Gr1(+) cells to the brain. In addition, PHZ administration significantly increased the numbers of IL-12-secreting DCs at days 3 and 5 p.i. compared to those of untreated control infected mice (P   <0.001 and P   <0.01, respectively). Consequently, the activation of CD4(+) T cells, especially the expansion of the Th1 subset (P   <0.05), was significantly and dramatically enhanced and was accompanied by marked increases in the production of protein and/or mRNA of the Th1-type pro-inflammatory mediators, IFN-y and TNF-a (P   <0.01 for both for protein; P   <0.05 for TNF-a mRNA). Our results suggest that, compared to healthy individuals, people suffering from reticulocytosis may be more susceptible to severe malaria infection in malaria endemic areas. This has implications for the most appropriate selection of treatment, which may also cause reticulocytosis in patients living in such areas.

26116851|t|Clinical Differentiation of Upper Extremity Pain Etiologies.
26116851|a|UNASSIGNED: Upper extremity pain can result from many overlapping etiologies. These can be categorized into anatomic regions and specific organ systems. Anatomically, pain etiologies are classified into four major groups: neurologic, musculoskeletal, vascular, and other (eg, tumor, infection). Knowledge of the characteristic clinical presentation and physical examination findings of each group can help distinguish the source of the patient's complaints quickly so that an accurate clinical diagnosis can facilitate appropriate diagnostic measures and treatment. A focus on the neurologic causes of upper extremity pain (ie, cervical spine pathology, peripheral nerve compression, neuropathy) and musculoskeletal causes of shoulder and elbow pain (eg, adhesive capsulitis, calcific tendinitis, biceps tendinitis, synovitis) and the distinguishing characteristics (eg, periscapular pain, two-point discrimination, signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI) helps determine the appropriate diagnosis.

26119759|t|Optimal treatment allocation for placebo-treatment comparisons in trials with discrete-time survival endpoints.
26119759|a|UNASSIGNED: In many randomized controlled trials, treatment groups are of equal size, but this is not necessarily the best choice. This paper provides a methodology to calculate optimal treatment allocations for longitudinal trials when we wish to compare multiple treatment groups with a placebo group, and the comparisons may have unequal importance. The focus is on trials with a survival endpoint measured in discrete time. We assume the underlying survival process is Weibull and show that values for the parameters in the Weibull distribution have an impact on the optimal treatment allocation scheme in an interesting way. Additionally, we incorporate different cost considerations at the subject and measurement levels and determine the optimal number of time periods. We also show that when many events occur at the beginning of the trial, fewer time periods are more efficient. As an application, we revisit a risperidone maintenance treatment trial in schizophrenia and use our proposed methodology to redesign it and compare merits of our optimal design.

26118786|t|Grading Osteoarthritic Changes of the Zygapophyseal Joints from Radiographs: A Reliability Study.
26118786|a|OBJECTIVE: This study tested the reliability of a 5-point ordinal scale used to grade the severity of degenerative changes of zygapophyseal (Z) joints on standard radiographs. METHODS: Modifications were made to a Kellgren grading system to improve agreement for grading the severity of osteoarthritic changes in lumbar Z joints. These included adding 1 grade of no degeneration, multiple radiographic views, and structured examiner training. Thirty packets of radiographic files were obtained, which included representation of all 5 grades including no degeneration (0) and Kellgren's 4-point (1-4) joint degeneration classification criteria. Radiographs were digitized to create a radiographic atlas that was given to examiners for individual study and blinded evaluation sessions. Intrarater and interrater agreement was determined by weighted k (kw) from the examination of 79 Z joints (25 packets). RESULTS: Using the modified scale and after training, examiners demonstrated a moderate-to-substantial level of interrater agreement (kw = 0.57, 0.60, and 0.68). Intrarater agreement was moderate (kw = 0.42 and 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: The modified Kellgren 5-point grading system provides acceptable intrarater and interrater reliability when examiners are adequately trained. This grading system may be a useful method for future investigations assessing radiographic osteoarthritis of the Z joints.

26120296|t|Potential harmful health effects of inhaling nicotine-free shisha-pen vapor: a chemical risk assessment of the main components propylene glycol and glycerol.
26120296|a|BACKGROUND: A shisha-pen is an electronic cigarette variant that is advertised to mimic the taste of a water pipe, or shisha. The aim of this study was to assess the potential harmful health effects caused by inhaling the vapor of a nicotine-free shisha-pen. METHODS: Gas chromatography analysis was performed to determine the major components in shisha-pen vapor. Risk assessment was performed using puff volumes of e-cigarettes and "normal" cigarettes and a 1-puff scenario (one-time exposure). The concentrations that reached the airways and lungs after using a shisha-pen were calculated and compared to data from published toxicity studies. RESULTS: The main components in shisha-pen vapor are propylene glycol and glycerol (54%/46%). One puff (50 to 70  mL) results in exposure of propylene glycol and glycerol of 430 to 603  mg/m(3) and 348 to 495  mg/m(3), respectively. These exposure concentrations were higher than the points of departure for airway irritation based on a human study (propylene glycol, mean concentration of 309  mg/m(3)) and a rat study (glycerol, no-observed adverse effect level of 165  mg/m(3)). CONCLUSIONS: Already after one puff of the shisha-pen, the concentrations of propylene glycol and glycerol are sufficiently high to potentially cause irritation of the airways. New products such as the shisha-pen should be detected and risks should be assessed to inform regulatory actions aimed at limiting potential harm that may be caused to consumers and protecting young people to take up smoking.

26093180|t|Morphological observation of embryoid bodies completes the in vitro evaluation of nanomaterial embryotoxicity in the embryonic stem cell test (EST).
26093180|a|UNASSIGNED: The wide and frequent use of engineered nanomaterials (NMs) raises serious concerns about their safety for human health. Our aim is to evaluate the embryotoxic potential of silver, uncoated and coated zinc oxide, titanium dioxide and silica NMs through the embryonic stem cell test (EST). EST is a validated in vitro assay that permits classification of chemicals into three classes (non, weakly or strongly embryotoxic). Because of the peculiar physico-chemical characteristics of NMs, we first adapted and simplified the differentiation protocol. To verify the efficiency of this adapted protocol we screened 3 well-characterized chemicals (5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea and saccharin). Next, we assessed the embryotoxic potential of NMs. Our data showed that silver NM is classified as a strong embryotoxic compound, while coated and uncoated zinc oxide, titanium and silica NMs as weak embryotoxic compounds. In addition, we observed daily the formation and growth of embryoid bodies (EBs). We showed that multiple EBs formed in each well starting from 50 g/ml of SiO2 while EB formation was inhibited starting from 20 g/ml of ZnO NMs. This has never been reported with chemicals and could pose a risk of wrongly evaluating the NMs embryotoxic potential. For NMs, morphological observation of EBs can provide valuable information on early differentiation effects. Finally, we suggest that the prediction model should be revised for the assessment of NMs embryotoxicity.

26085647|t|Pericyte Antigens in Perivascular Soft Tissue Tumors.
26085647|a|INTRODUCTION: Perivascular soft tissue tumors are relatively uncommon neoplasms of unclear line of differentiation, although most are presumed to originate from pericytes or modified perivascular cells. Among these, glomus tumor, myopericytoma, and angioleiomyoma share a spectrum of histologic findings and a perivascular growth pattern. In contrast, solitary fibrous tumor (previously termed hemangiopericytoma) was once hypothesized to have pericytic differentiation. METHODS: Here, we systematically examine pericyte immunohistochemical markers among glomus tumor (including malignant glomus tumor), myopericytoma, angioleiomyoma, and solitary fibrous tumor. Immunohistochemical staining and semiquantification was performed using well-defined pericyte antigens, including aSMA, CD146, and PDGFRb. RESULTS: Glomus tumor and myopericytoma demonstrate diffuse staining for all pericyte markers, including immunohistochemical reactivity for aSMA, CD146, and PDGFRb. Malignant glomus tumors all showed some degree of pericyte marker immunoreactivity, although it was significantly reduced. Angioleiomyoma shared a similar aSMA + CD146 + PDGFRb+ immunophenotype; however, this was predominantly seen in the areas of perivascular tumor growth. Solitary fibrous tumors showed patchy PDGFRb immunoreactivity only. DISCUSSION: In summary, pericyte marker expression is a ubiquitous finding in glomus tumor, myopericytoma, and angioleiomyoma. Malignant glomus tumor shows a comparative reduction in pericyte marker expression, which may represent partial loss of pericytic differentiation. Pericyte markers are essentially not seen in solitary fibrous tumor. The combination of aSMA, CD146, and PDGFRb immunohistochemical stainings may be of utility for the evaluation of pericytic differentiation in soft tissue tumors.

26013673|t|Influence of green tea extract on oxidative damage and apoptosis induced by deltamethrin in rat brain.
26013673|a|UNASSIGNED: In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of an aqueous extract of green tea leaves (GTE) against neurotoxicity and oxidative damage induced by deltamethrin (DM) in male rats. Four different groups of rats were used: the 1st group was the vehicle treated control group, the 2nd group received DM (0.6mg/kg BW), the 3rd group received DM plus GTE, and the 4th received GTE alone (25mg/kg BW). The brain tissues were collected at the end of the experimental regimen for subsequent investigation. Rats that were given DM had a highly significant elevation in MDA content, nitric oxide concentration, DNA fragmentation and expression level of apoptotic genes, TP53 and COX2. Additionally, a significant reduction in the total antioxidant capacity in the second group was detected. The findings for the 3rd group highlight the efficacy of GTE as a neuro-protectant in DM-induced neurotoxicity through improving the oxidative status and DNA fragmentation as well as suppressing the expression of the TP53 and COX2 genes. In conclusion, GTE, at a concentration of 25mg/kg/day, protected against DM-induced neurotoxicity through its antioxidant and antiapoptotic influence; therefore, it can be used as a protective natural product against DM-induced neurotoxicity.

26120587|t|Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Relationship with Metabolic Syndrome in Class III Obesity Individuals.
26120587|a|Introduction. Obesity is represented mainly by abdominal obesity and insulin resistance (IR), both present in most individuals diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (MS). IR is the key risk factor in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Objective. To relate NAFLD to MS in class III obese individuals. Methodology. A descriptive cross-sectional study with class III obese individuals, aged >=  20-60 years. Blood pressure measurement, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and blood glucose, insulin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and triglycerides data were obtained. HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance) calculation was carried out with a cutoff value of 2.71 for IR evaluation. The diagnosis of NAFLD was performed by liver biopsy and the diagnosis of MS was performed in accordance with the National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEPATP III). Results. Of the 50 individuals evaluated, 86% were women and BMI means were 45.4        3.6   Kg/m(2). The overall individuals had NAFLD, 70% steatosis, and 30% steatohepatitis. The diagnosis of MS occurred in 56% but showed no significant association with NAFLD (P = 0.254). Triglycerides (178        65.5   mg/dL) and insulin (28.2        22.6   mcU/mL) mean values were significantly higher in steatohepatitis (P = 0.002 and P = 0.042, resp.) compared to individuals with steatosis. IR was confirmed in 76% and showed a relationship with NAFLD severity. Conclusion. NAFLD was not related to MS; however, MS components, evaluated in isolation, as well as IR, were related to the presence and severity of NAFLD.

26120869|t|The protective role of Ternatin Anthocyanins and Quercetin Glycosides from Butterfly Pea (Clitoria ternatea Leguminosae) Blue flower Petals against LPS-induced inflammation in Macrophage Cells.
26120869|a|UNASSIGNED: From the blue flowers of Clitoria ternatea twelve phenolic metabolites (9 Ternatin anthocyanins and 3 glycosylated quercetins) were identified by high- performance liquid chromatography diode array detection and electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI/MSn). Three anthocyanins not reported in this species before show fragmentation pattern of the Ternatin class. Extracts were fractionated in fractions containing flavonols (F3) and Ternatin anthocyanins (F4). In general, Clitoria ternatea polyphenols showed anti-inflammatory properties in LPS-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells with distinct molecular targets. Flavonols (F3) showed strong inhibition of COX-2 activity and partial ROS suppression. On the other hand the Ternatin anthocyanins (F4) inhibited nuclear NF-kB translocation, iNOS protein expression and NO production through a non-ROS suppression mechanism. Accordingly, quercetin glycosides and Ternatin anthocyanins from the blue flower petals of Clitoria ternatea may be useful in developing drugs or nutraceuticals for protection against chronic inflammatory diseases by suppressing the excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators from macrophage cells.

26118973|a|UNASSIGNED: The lack of high-efficient, low-cost, and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts that act simultaneously for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is currently one of the major obstacles to commercializing the electrical rechargeability of zinc-air batteries. A nanocomposite CoO-NiO-NiCo bifunctional electrocatalyst supported by nitrogen-doped multiwall carbon nanotubes (NCNT/CoO-NiO-NiCo) exhibits excellent activity and stability for the ORR/OER in alkaline media. More importantly, real air cathodes made from the bifunctional NCNT/CoO-NiO-NiCo catalysts further demonstrated superior performance to state-of-the-art Pt/C or Pt/C+IrO2 catalysts in primary and rechargeable zinc-air batteries.

26048678|t|Capillary nano-immunoassays: advancing quantitative proteomics analysis, biomarker assessment, and molecular diagnostics.
26048678|a|UNASSIGNED: There is an emerging demand for the use of molecular profiling to facilitate biomarker identification and development, and to stratify patients for more efficient treatment decisions with reduced adverse effects. In the past decade, great strides have been made to advance genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to address these demands. While there has been much progress with these large scale approaches, profiling at the protein level still faces challenges due to limitations in clinical sample size, poor reproducibility, unreliable quantitation, and lack of assay robustness. A novel automated capillary nano-immunoassay (CNIA) technology has been developed. This technology offers precise and accurate measurement of proteins and their post-translational modifications using either charge-based or size-based separation formats. The system not only uses ultralow nanogram levels of protein but also allows multi-analyte analysis using a parallel single-analyte format for increased sensitivity and specificity. The high sensitivity and excellent reproducibility of this technology make it  particularly powerful for analysis of clinical samples. Furthermore, the system can distinguish and detect specific protein post-translational modifications that conventional Western blot and other immunoassays cannot easily capture. This review will summarize and evaluate the latest progress to optimize the CNIA system for comprehensive, quantitative protein and signaling event characterization. It will also discuss how the technology has been successfully applied in both discovery research and clinical studies, for signaling pathway dissection, proteomic biomarker assessment, targeted treatment evaluation and quantitative proteomic analysis. Lastly, a comparison of this novel system with other conventional immuno-assay platforms is performed.

26044800|t|Future of Sleep-Disordered Breathing Therapy Using a Mechanistic Approach.
26044800|a|UNASSIGNED: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is highly prevalent among patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), and the relationship between SDB and CVD may be bidirectional. However, SDB remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. One of the major barriers identified by cardiologists is lack of satisfaction with SDB therapy. This situation could be the result of the discordance between treatment and the pathophysiological characteristics of SDB. This condition is caused by multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, which could be classified into upper airway anatomic compromise, pharyngeal dilator muscle dysfunction, and ventilatory control instability. However, the effective treatment of SDB remains limited, and positive airway pressure therapy is still the mainstay of the treatment. Therefore, we review the pathophysiological characteristics of SDB in this article, and we propose to provide individualized treatment of SDB based on the underlying mechanism. This approach requires further study but could potentially improve adherence and success of therapy.

26033188|t|The success of assisted colonization and assisted gene flow depends on phenology.
26033188|a|UNASSIGNED: Global warming will jeopardize the persistence and genetic diversity of many species. Assisted colonization, or the movement of species beyond their current range boundary, is a conservation strategy proposed for species with limited dispersal abilities or adaptive potential. However, species that rely on photoperiodic and thermal cues for development may experience conflicting signals if transported across latitudes. Relocating multiple, distinct populations may remedy this quandary by expanding genetic variation and promoting evolutionary responses in the receiving habitat - a strategy known as assisted gene flow. In order to better inform these policies, we planted seeds from latitudinally distinct populations of the annual legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, in a potential future colonization site north of its current range boundary. Plants were exposed to ambient or elevated temperatures via infrared heating. We monitored several life history traits and estimated patterns of natural selection in order to determine the adaptive value of plastic responses. To assess the feasibility of assisted gene flow between phenologically distinct populations, we counted flowers each day and estimated the degree of temporal isolation between populations. Increased temperatures advanced each successive phenological trait more than the last, resulting in a compressed life cycle for all but the southern-most population. Warming altered patterns of selection on flowering onset and vegetative biomass. Population performance was dependent on latitude of origin, with the northern-most population performing best under ambient conditions and the southern-most performing most poorly, even under elevated temperatures. Among-population differences in flowering phenology limited the potential for genetic exchange among the northern and southern-most populations. All plastic responses to warming were neutral or adaptive, however photoperiodic constraints will likely necessitate evolutionary responses for long-term persistence, especially when involving populations from disparate latitudes. With strategic planning, our results suggest that assisted colonization and assisted gene flow may be feasible options for preservation. This article is protected by copyright.

26039325|t|Endothelial cell and Podocyte Autophagy Synergistically protect from Diabetes-induced Glomerulosclerosis.
26039325|a|UNASSIGNED: The glomerulus is a highly specialized capillary tuft, which under pressure filters large amounts of water and small solutes into the urinary space, whilst retaining albumin and large proteins. The glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) is a highly specialized filtration interface between blood and urine that is highly permeable to small and midsized solutes in plasma but relatively impermeable to macromolecules such as albumin. The integrity of the GFB is maintained by molecular interplay between its 3  layers: the glomerular endothelium, the glomerular basement membrane and podocytes, which are highly specialized postmitotic pericytes forming the outer part of the GFB. Abnormalities of glomerular ultrafiltration lead to the loss of proteins in urine and progressive renal insufficiency, underlining the importance of the GFB. Indeed, albuminuria is strongly predictive of the course of chronic nephropathies especially that of diabetic nephropathy (DN), a leading cause of renal insufficiency. We found that high glucose concentrations promote autophagy flux in podocyte cultures and that the abundance of LC3B II in podocytes is high in diabetic mice. Deletion of Atg5 specifically in podocytes resulted in accelerated diabetes-induced podocytopathy with a leaky GFB and glomerulosclerosis. Strikingly, genetic alteration of autophagy on the other side of the GFB involving the endothelial-specific deletion of Atg5 also resulted in capillary rarefaction and accelerated DN. Thus autophagy is a key protective mechanism on both cellular layers of the GFB suggesting autophagy as a promising new therapeutic strategy for DN.

26038936|t|Influence of operating parameters on the fate and removal of three estrogens in a laboratory-scale AAO system.
26038936|a|UNASSIGNED: A laboratory-scale anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (AAO) process was constructed to investigate the influence of hydraulic residence time (HRT) and sludge retention time (SRT) on the removal and fate of estrone (E1), 17b-estradiol (E2) and 17a-ethinylestradiol (EE2), and their removal mechanisms in a biological treatment system. In an HRT range of 5-15 h, the highest removal efficiencies for E1, E2 and EE2 were obtained at an HRT of 8 h, with values of 91.2, 94.6 and 81.5%, respectively. When the SRT was increased from 10 to 20 d, all three estrogen removal efficiencies stayed above 80%, while the optimal SRT for each estrogen was different. The contribution of each tank for removal of the three estrogens was in the order of aerobic tank > anoxic tank > anaerobic tank. The optimal HRT and SRT for the removal of both the three estrogens and nutrients were 8 h and 15d, respectively. At this condition, respectively, about 50.7, 70.1 and 11.3% of E1, E2 and EE2 were biodegraded, 28.8, 17.2 and 50% were accumulated in the system, 8.3, 5.4 and 17.3% were discharged in the effluent, and 12.2, 7.3 and 20.34% were transported into excess sludge. It indicated that biodegradation by sludge microorganisms was the main removal mechanism of E1 and E2, while adsorption onto sludge was the main mechanism for EE2 removal.

26058435|t|[No effect of the use of varicose vein treatment compression after more than seven days].
26058435|a|UNASSIGNED: The aim of this article is to review the current use of compression after varicose vein treatment. Five randomized controlled trials and one systematic review was chosen for evaluation. No benefit was found when comparing either long duration compression with short duration, or compression with no compression. Additionally, patient compliance was low. The evidence is based on underpowered and heterogeneous groups. Thus, no contribution to a consensus regarding the use of post varicose vein treatment compression can be made.

26059971|t|Heterosis and outbreeding depression in crosses between natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana.
26059971|a|Understanding the causes and architecture of genetic differentiation between natural populations is of central importance in evolutionary biology. Crosses between natural populations can result in heterosis if recessive or nearly recessive deleterious mutations have become fixed within populations because of genetic drift. Divergence between populations can also result in outbreeding depression because of genetic incompatibilities. The net fitness consequences of between-population crosses will be a balance between heterosis and outbreeding depression. We estimated the magnitude of heterosis and outbreeding depression in the highly selfing model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, by crossing replicate line pairs from two sets of natural populations (C   R, B   S) separated by similar geographic distances (Italy   Sweden). We examined the contribution of different modes of gene action to overall differences in estimates of lifetime fitness and fitness components using joint scaling tests with parental, reciprocal F1 and F2, and backcross lines. One of these population pairs (C   R) was previously demonstrated to be locally adapted, but locally maladaptive quantitative trait loci were also found, suggesting a role for genetic drift in shaping adaptive variation. We found markedly different genetic architectures for fitness and fitness components in the two sets of populations. In one (C   R), there were consistently positive effects of dominance, indicating the masking of recessive or nearly recessive deleterious mutations that had become fixed by genetic drift. The other set (B   S) exhibited outbreeding depression because of negative dominance effects. Additional studies are needed to explore the molecular genetic basis of heterosis and outbreeding depression, and how their magnitudes vary across environments.

26061297|t|Radiolabelled nanoparticles: novel classification of radiopharmaceuticals for molecular imaging of cancer.
26061297|a|UNASSIGNED: Nanotechnology has been used for every single modality in the molecular imaging arena for imaging purposes. Synergic advantages can be explored when multiple molecular imaging modalities are combined with respect to single imaging modalities. Multifunctional nanoparticles have large surface areas, where multiple functional moieties can be incorporated, including ligands for site-specific targeting and radionuclides, which can be detected to create 3D images. Recently, radiolabeled nanoparticles with individual properties have attracted great interest regarding their use in multimodality tumor imaging. Multifunctional nanoparticles can combine diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities for both target-specific diagnosis and the treatment of a given disease. The future of nanomedicine lies in multifunctional nanoplatforms that combine the diagnostic ability and therapeutic effects using appropriate ligands, drugs, responses and technological devices, which together are collectively called theranostic drugs. Co-delivery of radiolabeled nanoparticles is useful in multifunctional molecular imaging areas because it comprises several advantages based on nanoparticles architecture, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties.

26058894|t|Left Atrial Dysfunction Assessed by Two-Dimensional Speckle Tracking Echocardiography in Patients with Impaired Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction and Sleep-Disordered Breathing.
26058894|a|AIMS: To evaluate the relationship between left atrial (LA) structure and deformation obtained by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2DSTE): peak longitudinal systolic strain (LAs), peak longitudinal systolic strain rate (LAS-SR), peak longitudinal early diastolic strain rate (LAE-SR), peak longitudinal late diastolic strain rate (LAA-SR), and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) estimated by means of apnea-hypopnea index (eAHI). METHODS: Thirty-two individuals with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (EF  <  50%) were included in the study. LA function was assessed using 2DSTE. eAHI index was calculated by means of the 24-hour ambulatory Holter electrocardiogram monitoring. Patients were categorized into two subgroups: SDB group (eAHI  >=   15; n  =  15) and non-SDB group (eAHI  <  15; n  =  17). RESULTS: All 2DSTE parameters were decreased in the SDB group: LAS-SR (0.90 [0.60-1.25] 1/sec vs. 1.25 [1.00-1.27] 1/sec, P  =  0.043), LAE-SR (-0.76      0.49 1/sec vs. -1.18      0.55 1/sec, P  =  0.033), and LAA-SR (-1.26      0.71 1/sec vs. -1.48      0.75 1/sec, P  =  0.049). The eAHI was negatively correlated with LA reservoir function: LAS (r  =  -0.53, P  =  0.002) and LAS-SR (r  =  -0.47, P  =  0.006), while it is positively correlated with LAE-SR (r  =  0.67, P  <  0.001) and LAA-SR (r  =  0.46, P  =  0.009). Moreover, SDB severity was an independent predictor of impaired LA compliance (P  =  0.016) and conduit function (P  =  0.002) in multivariate linear regression model, even after adjustment for age, BMI, gender, LV systolic (EF), and diastolic (E/e') function and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: LA dysfunction and remodeling assessed using 2DSTE in patients with impaired systolic LV function, and IHD is influenced by the severity of sleep apnea independently from LV function.

26004902|t|Encapsulated boron as an osteoinductive agent for bone scaffolds.
26004902|a|The aim of this study was to develop boron (B)-releasing polymeric scaffold to promote regeneration of bone tissue. Boric acid-doped chitosan nanoparticles with a diameter of approx. 175nm were produced by tripolyphosphate (TPP)-initiated ionic gelation process. The nanoparticles strongly attached via electrostatic interactions into chitosan scaffolds produced by freeze-drying with approx. 100 m pore diameter. According to the ICP-OES results, following first 5h initial burst release, fast release of B from scaffolds was observed for 24h incubation period in conditioned medium. Then, slow release of B was performed over 120h. The results of the cell culture studies proved that the encapsulated boron within the scaffolds can be used as an osteoinductive agent by showing its positive effects on the proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cells.

26005380|t|High prevalence of early chronic kidney disease in high risk outpatients.
26005380|a|INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health problem. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of early stages of renal disease in hypertensive and diabetic outpatients without previously diagnosed renal damages. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we studied a random sample of outpatients with essential hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus type 2 in the general practice ambulance of city Sarajevo. Renal function was evaluated by using MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) equation and with measurement of renal biomarkers. K/DOQI classification was used to define the stages of CKD. RESULTS: The study included 200 patients, of whom 75 (37.5%) were females, mean age of 54.81    6.1 years, and 125 (62.5%) male, mean age 52.46    8.2 years. More than half of respondents (54.0%) were hypertensive during the follow up period. Early CKD was detected in 52% respondents. Higher prevalence of early CKD was verified in the group of patients who had hypertension associated with diabetes mellitus type 2 (59.6% vs. 47.2% in hypertension group vs. 54,0% in diabetic group, p<0.05). Significant negative correlation was found between estimated glomerular filtration rate and presence of albuminuria (p<0.001), duration of hypertension (p=0.003), duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus (p=0.021), stages of hypertension (p=0.012), female gender (p<0.001) and older age of subjects (p=0.040). CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed high prevalence of CKD and the importance of early detection of CKD in high risk groups of patients in order to prevent the progression of the same. Prevention of chronic kidney disease in our country is still not carried out satisfactorily. Required is a much greater collaboration between primary care health givers and nephrologists.

26010042|t|Ecosystem-level effects of a globally-spreading invertebrate invader are not moderated by a functionally similar native.
26010042|a|UNASSIGNED: 1.Biological invasions are a key element of human-induced global environmental change. However, lack of knowledge of the indirect consequences of invasions, combined with poor understanding of how their ecological effects depend upon competitive attributes of the receiving community, hinders our ability to manage and predict the effects of invasive species on ecosystems. 2.We established an experiment using a combination of both additive and substitutive experimental designs to explore effects of the globally-spreading mysid shrimp Hemimysis anomala on the biological structure of outdoor pond mecososms in the absence and presence of a functionally similar native competitor, Mysis salemaai. 3.The naturally smaller H. anomala had considerably stronger effects on primary producers, multiple aspects of consumer assemblages and overall biological structure of the ponds in comparison to the functionally similar native. Moreover, the magnitude of these effects was generally independent of the presence of M. salemaai and even total mysid density. H. anomala reduced both the abundance and diversity of zooplankton assemblages significantly, triggering a strong trophic cascade on phytoplankton and a simultaneous increase of benthic invertebrate biomass. These findings indicate that invasion by H. anomala may exacerbate the effects of nutrient enrichment on lakes. 4.Our results demonstrate that introduced species can, irrespective of the presence of functionally similar natives, induce complex changes to ecosystems that reach beyond direct consumptive effects. Moreover, the cascading indirect effects of invasion can exacerbate the impacts of other stressors. Disregarding the complexity of indirect effects therefore risks underestimating significantly the global ecological footprint of biological invasions. This article is protected by copyright.

26009837|t|Implementation and Operational Research: Scaling Up the Provision of the PMTCT Services, Using the Linked Response Approach in Cambodia From 2008 to 2012.
26009837|a|INTRODUCTION: In Cambodia, the Linked Response (LR) approach for strengthening linkages between HIV and reproductive health services, especially for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT), was scaled up in 2009. This article describes the LR scale-up and the concomitant evolution of key PMTCT indicators at the national level. METHODS: A descriptive analysis of routine LR, PMTCT programme data, and national laboratory data from 2008 to 2012 was conducted. RESULTS: LR data show that between 2008 and 2012, the number of LR/PMTCT sites increased from 67 to 956 (of 1004) public health facilities to cover 74 (of 77) operational districts. In LR operational districts, the number of pregnant women (PW) tested for HIV increased from 41,800 in 2009 to 269,935 [of whom 375 (0.14%) were newly tested positive for HIV] in 2012; the number of PW living with HIV and exposed infants receiving antiretrovirals increased from 49 and 44 in 2009 to 720 and 551 in 2012, respectively. Concomitantly, national PMTCT programme data showed that the percent of PW tested for HIV increased from 34.4% (117,832 of 342,929 estimated PW) in 2008 to 86.1% (324,996 of 377,340) in 2012. In 2012, 65.3% (862 of 1321) of estimated HIV-positive PW and 72.7% (960 of 1321) of exposed infants received antiretrovirals. By 6-8 weeks postpartum, 7.4% (8 of 108) and 1.5% (6 of 409) of DNA-polymerase chain reaction tested positive in 2008 and in 2012, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The LR approach provided a model, which catalyzed increased access of PW to HIV testing and treatment, thereby contributing to the scale-up of PMTCT service provision and improved coverage in Cambodia.

26011499|t|Comparing Dose Rates Near a Radioactive Patient Evaluated Using Various Source Models: Point, Line, Cylinder, and Anthropomorphic Phantoms.
26011499|a|UNASSIGNED: This study investigated radiation exposures from nuclear medicine patients by systematically comparing the dose rates calculated using various source models, ranging from simplified point, line, and cylinder sources to high-quality anthropomorphic phantoms. Three widely used radionuclides, Tc, F, and I, were considered in these source models with uniform or organ-dependent distributions. Conducting Monte Carlo simulations with anthropomorphic phantoms is a realistic but time-consuming approach. The point source model is simple but too conservative, overestimating dose rates by approximately a factor of 2 at a distance of 30 cm and by 30-40% at 1 m. Both the line and cylinder source models provided improved estimates, reducing the overestimation of dose rates to 10-20% at distances of interest. The line source model was comparable to the cylinder source model because of the offset of two competing effects (i.e., attenuation and buildup) caused by the source volume. The influence of various photon energies and cylinder sizes on the result of compensating errors was examined to evaluate the effective range of the line source model. The line source model, which is relatively easy to implement and predicts slightly conservative dose rates, is considered the most practical method for calculating dose rates near radioactive patients. An application of the line source model to 51 post-thyroidectomy patients in Taiwan was demonstrated. The consistency between calculations and measurements was satisfactory after considering the room-scattering effect.

26011341|t|Can we use frozen section analysis of sentinel lymph nodes mapped with methylene blue dye for decision making upon one-time axillary dissection in breast carcinoma surgery in developing countries?
26011341|a|PURPOSE: To evaluate the accuracy of intraoperative frozen section analysis (FSA) of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) mapped using methylene blue dye (MBD) and its usefulness for selecting patients with breast carcinomas and positive axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) for one-time axillary dissection. METHODS: 152 female patients with T1/T2 breast carcinomas and clinically negative ALNs were selected for mapping using MBD (1%) from October 2010 to December 2011. Patients underwent FSA of mapped SLNs and ALN dissection. The accuracy of SLN-FSA was tested by comparing these findings with the definite histopathology (HP) of SLNs, as well as of other ALNs. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated. RESULTS: There was a 98%-match between FSA and definite HP findings of SLNs, suggesting high accuracy of FSA in this series. None of 3 patients with false-negative SLNs on FSA had additional axillary nodal metastases. One out of 20 (5%) patients with metastases in other ALNs had "clear" SLNs, both on FSA and definite HP (false-negative). Accuracy reached 94.1%. CONCLUSIONS: SLN-FSA enables adequate selection of patients for one-time axillary node dissection. MBD mapping technique is cheap, feasible and enables easy and precise detection of the first draining ALNs. Using FSA of SLNs mapped with MBD, patients with breast carcinoma benefit from complete surgical treatment during one hospitalization, the risk of undergoing anaesthesia twice is reduced, as well as the treatment cost, which is important in developing countries.

26037523|t|Bacteria influence mountain pine beetle brood development through interactions with symbiotic and antagonistic fungi: implications for climate-driven host range expansion.
26037523|a|UNASSIGNED: Bark beetles are associated with diverse communities of symbionts. Although fungi have received significant attention, we know little about how bacteria, and in particular their interactions with fungi, affect bark beetle reproduction. We tested how interactions between four bacterial associates, two symbiotic fungi, and two opportunistic fungi affect performance of mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in host tissue. We compared beetle performance in phloem of its historical host, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and its novel host recently accessed through warming climate, jack pine (Pinus banksiana). Overall, beetles produced more larvae, and established longer ovipositional and larval galleries in  host tissue predominantly colonized by the symbiotic fungi, Grosmannia clavigera, or Ophiostoma montium than by the opportunistic colonizer Aspergillus and to a lesser extent, Trichoderma. This occurred in both historical and na  ve hosts. Impacts of bacteria on beetle reproduction depended on particular fungus-bacterium combinations and host species. Some bacteria, e.g., Pseudomonas sp. D4-22 and Hy4T4 in P. contorta and Pseudomonas sp. Hy4T4 and Stenotrophomonas in P. banksiana, reduced antagonistic effects by Aspergillus and Trichoderma resulting in more larvae and longer ovipositional and larval galleries. These effects were not selective, as bacteria also reduced beneficial effects by symbionts in both host species. Interestingly, Bacillus enhanced antagonistic effects by Aspergillus in both hosts. These results demonstrate that bacteria influence brood development of bark beetles in host tissue. They also suggest that climate-driven range expansion of D. ponderosae through the boreal forest will not be significantly constrained by requirements of, or interactions among, its microbial associates.

26033209|t|Using facebook to recruit young adult veterans: online mental health research.
26033209|a|BACKGROUND: Veteran research has primarily been conducted with clinical samples and those already involved in health care systems, but much is to be learned about veterans in the community. Facebook is a novel yet largely unexplored avenue for recruiting veteran participants for epidemiological and clinical studies. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we utilized Facebook to recruit a sample of young adult veterans for the first phase of an online alcohol intervention study. We describe the successful Facebook recruitment process, including data collection from over 1000 veteran participants in approximately 3 weeks, procedures to verify participation eligibility, and comparison of our sample with nationally available norms. METHODS: Participants were young adult veterans aged 18-34 recruited through Facebook as part of a large study to document normative drinking behavior among a large community sample of veterans. Facebook ads were targeted toward young veterans to collect information on demographics and military characteristics, health behaviors, mental health, and health care utilization. RESULTS: We obtained a sample of 1023 verified veteran participants over a period of 24 days for the advertising price of approximately US  7.05 per verified veteran participant. Our recruitment strategy yielded a sample similar to the US population of young adult veterans in most demographic areas except for race/ethnicity and previous branch of service, which when we weighted the sample on race/ethnicity and branch a sample better matched with the population data was obtained. The Facebook sample recruited veterans who were engaged in a variety of risky health behaviors such as binge drinking and marijuana use. One fourth of veterans had never since discharge been to an appointment for physical health care and about half had attended an appointment for service compensation review. Only half had attended any appointment for a mental health concern at any clinic or hospital. Despite more than half screening positive for current probable mental health disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, only about 1 in 3 received mental health care in the past year and only 1 in 50 received such care within the past month. CONCLUSIONS: This work expands on the work of other studies that have examined clinical samples of veterans only and suggests Facebook can be an adequate method of obtaining samples of veterans in need of care.

26032016|t|Feasibility, acceptability, and characteristics associated with adherence and completion of a culturally relevant internet-enhanced physical activity pilot intervention for overweight and obese young adult African American women enrolled in college.
26032016|a|BACKGROUND: African American women are one of the least active demographic groups in the US, with only 36% meeting the national physical activity recommendations in comparison to 46% of White women. Physical activity begins to decline in African American women in adolescence and continues to decline into young adulthood. Yet, few interventions have been developed to promote physical activity in African American women during this critical period of life. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a culturally-relevant Internet-enhanced physical activity pilot intervention for overweight/obese African American college females and to examine psychosocial and behavioral characteristics associated with intervention adherence and completion. METHODS: A 6-month single group pre-posttest design was used. Participants (n  =  27) accessed a culturally-relevant Social Cognitive Theory-based physical activity promotion website while engaging in a minimum of four moderate-intensity physical activity sessions each week. Acceptability and feasibility of the intervention was assessed by participant retention and a consumer satisfaction survey completed by participants. RESULTS: Fifty-six percent of participants (n  =  15) completed the intervention. Study completers were more physically active at baseline (P  =  0.05) and had greater social support for exercise from family members (P  =  0.04). Sixty percent of study completers (n  =  9) reported the website as "enjoyable" or "very enjoyable" to use and 60% (n  =  9) reported increased motivation from participation in the physical activity program. Moreover, 87% (n  =  13) reported they would recommend the website to a friend. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide some preliminary support for the acceptability and feasibility of an Internet-enhanced physical activity program for overweight/obese African American women, while highlighting important limitations of the approach. Successful promotion of physical activity in college aged African American women as they emerge into adulthood may result in the development of life-long healthy physical activity patterns which may ultimately reduce physical activity-related health disparities in this high risk underserved population. Future studies with larger samples are needed to further explore the use of Internet-based programs to promote physical activity in this population.

26040980|t|Neurobiological mechanisms associated with facial affect recognition deficits after traumatic brain injury.
26040980|a|UNASSIGNED: The neurobiological mechanisms that underlie facial affect recognition deficits after traumatic brain injury (TBI) have not yet been identified. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), study aims were to 1) determine if there are differences in brain activation during facial affect processing in people with TBI who have facial affect recognition impairments (TBI-I) relative to people with TBI and healthy controls who do not have facial affect recognition impairments (TBI-N and HC, respectively); and 2) identify relationships between neural activity and facial affect recognition performance. A facial affect recognition screening task performed outside the scanner was used to determine group classification; TBI patients who performed greater than one standard deviation below normal performance scores were classified as TBI-I, while TBI patients with normal scores were classified as TBI-N. An fMRI facial recognition paradigm was then performed within the 3T environment. Results from 35 participants are reported (TBI-I   =   11, TBI-N   =   12, and HC   =   12). For the fMRI task, TBI-I and TBI-N groups scored significantly lower than the HC group. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals for facial affect recognition compared to a baseline condition of viewing a scrambled face, revealed lower neural activation in the right fusiform gyrus (FG) in the TBI-I group than the HC group. Right fusiform gyrus activity correlated with accuracy on the facial affect recognition tasks (both within and outside the scanner). Decreased FG activity suggests facial affect recognition deficits after TBI may be the result of impaired holistic face processing. Future directions and clinical implications are discussed.

26118437|t|Multimodality therapy approaches, local and systemic treatment, compared with chemotherapy alone in recurrent glioblastoma.
26118437|a|BACKGROUND: Long-term local control in Glioblastoma is rarely achieved and nearly all patients relapse. In this study we evaluated the clinical effect of different treatment approaches in recurrent patients. METHODS: Forty-three patients, with median age of 51  years were evaluated for salvage treatment: re-resection and/or re-irradiation plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Response was recorded using the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria. Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0. Twenty-one patients underwent chemotherapy combined with local treatment, surgery and/or radiation therapy, and 22 underwent chemotherapy only. RESULTS: The median follow up was 7  months (range 3-28 months). The 1 and 2-years Progression Free Survival was 65 and 10  % for combined treatment and 22 and 0  % for chemotherapy alone (p   <   0.01). The 1 and 2-years overall survival was 69 and 29  % for combined and 26 and 0  % for chemotherapy alone (p   <   0.01). No toxicity greater than grade 2 was recorded. CONCLUSION: These data showed that in glioblastoma recurrence the combination of several approaches in a limited group of patients is more effective than a single treatment alone. This stress the importance of multimodality treatment whenever clinically feasible.

26121563|t|Passenger strand loading in overexpression experiments using microRNA mimics.
26121563|a|UNASSIGNED: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene function and manipulation of miRNAs is a central component of basic research. Modulation of gene expression by miRNA gain-of-function can be based on different approaches including transfection with miRNA mimics; artificial, chemically modified miRNA-like small RNAs. These molecules are intended to mimic the function of a miRNA guide strand while bypassing the maturation steps of endogenous miRNAs. Due to easy accessibility through commercial providers this approach has gained popularity, and accuracy is often assumed without prior independent testing. Our in silico analysis of over-represented sequence motifs in microarray expression data and sequencing of AGO-associated small RNAs indicate, however, that miRNA mimics may be associated with considerable side-effects due to the unwanted activity of the miRNA mimic complementary strand.

26047717|t|Targeted release and fractionation reveal glucuronylated and sulphated N- and O-glycans in larvae of dipteran insects.
26047717|a|UNASSIGNED: Mosquitoes are important vectors of parasitic and viral diseases with Anopheles gambiae transmitting malaria and Aedes aegypti spreading yellow and Dengue fevers. Using two different approaches (solid-phase extraction and reversed-phase or hydrophilic interaction HPLC fractionation followed by MALDI-TOF MS or permethylation followed by NSI-MS), we examined the N-glycans of both A. gambiae and A. aegypti larvae and demonstrate the presence of a range of paucimannosidic glycans as well as bi- and tri-antennary glycans, some of which are modified with fucose or with sulphate or glucuronic acid residues; the latter anionic modifications were also found on N-glycans of larvae from another dipteran species (Drosophila melanogaster). The sulphate groups are attached primarily to core a-mannose residues (especially the a1,6-linked mannose), whereas the glucuronic acid residues are linked to non-reducing b1,3-galactose. Also, O-glycans were found to possess glucuronic acid and sulphate as well as phosphoethanolamine modifications. The presence of sulphated and glucuronylated N-glycans is a novel feature in dipteran glycomes; these structures have the potential to act as additional anionic glycan ligands involved in parasite interactions with the vector host.

26119503|a|UNASSIGNED: Adolescents in disadvantaged communities have high rates of exposure to stress and trauma, which can negatively impact emotion regulation and executive functioning, increasing likelihood of school problems. This pilot study evaluated RAP Club, a 12-session school-based trauma-informed group intervention co-facilitated by a mental health counselor and young adult community member that utilizes evidence-based cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness strategies. Seventh and eighth graders at two urban public schools serving low-income communities were assigned to receive RAP Club (n  =  29) or regular school programming (n  =  20). RAP Club improved teacher-rated emotion regulation, social and academic competence, classroom behavior, and discipline. Higher program dose predicted improvements in several teacher-rated outcomes. Student self-report outcomes, however, did not vary by study group or dose. Even students with low baseline depression showed improvement in teacher-rated outcomes following program participation, supporting a model of universal program delivery to all students. Findings suggest RAP Club merits further study.

26105995|t|Developmentally regulated HEART STOPPER, a mitochondrially targeted L18 ribosomal protein gene, is required for cell division, differentiation, and seed development in Arabidopsis.
26105995|a|UNASSIGNED: Evidence is presented for the role of a mitochondrial ribosomal (mitoribosomal) L18 protein in cell division, differentiation, and seed development after the characterization of a recessive mutant, heart stopper (hes). The hes mutant produced uncellularized endosperm and embryos arrested at the late globular stage. The mutant embryos differentiated partially on rescue medium with some forming callus. HES (At1g08845) encodes a mitochondrially targeted member of a highly diverged L18 ribosomal protein family. The substitution of a conserved amino residue in the hes mutant potentially perturbs mitoribosomal function via altered binding of 5S rRNA and/or influences the stability of the 50S ribosomal subunit, affecting mRNA binding and translation. Consistent with this, marker genes for mitochondrial dysfunction were up-regulated in the mutant. The slow growth of the endosperm and embryo indicates a defect in cell cycle progression, which is evidenced by the down-regulation of cell cycle genes. The down-regulation of other genes such as EMBRYO DEFECTIVE genes links the mitochondria to the regulation of many aspects of seed development. HES expression is developmentally regulated, being preferentially expressed in tissues with active cell division and differentiation, including developing embryos and the root tips. The divergence of the L18 family, the tissue type restricted expression of HES, and the failure of other L18 members to complement the hes phenotype suggest that the L18 proteins are involved in modulating development. This is likely via heterogeneous mitoribosomes containing different L18 members, which may result in differential mitochondrial functions in response to different physiological situations during development.

26107053|t|Advanced Dementia.
26107053|a|UNASSIGNED: Key Clinical Points Advanced Dementia Advanced dementia is a leading cause of death in the United States. Features include profound memory deficits (e.g., inability to recognize family), minimal verbal communication, loss of ambulatory abilities, the inability to perform activities of daily living, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The most common clinical complications are eating problems and infections, and these require management decisions. Advance care planning is a cornerstone of care. Treatment decisions should be guided by the goals of care; more than 90% of health care proxies state that patient comfort is the primary goal. Observational studies do not show any benefits of tube feeding in persons with advanced dementia, and tube feeding is not recommended. Observational studies show several benefits of hospice care. Patients with advanced dementia should be offered palliative and hospice care services if they are available.

26071181|t|The Adhesion GPCR CD97/ADGRE5 inhibits apoptosis.
26071181|a|UNASSIGNED: The Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) CD97/ADGRE5 is induced, upregulated, and/or biochemically modified in various malignancies, compared to the corresponding normal tissues. As tumor cells are generally more resistant to apoptosis, we here studied the ability of CD97 to regulate tumor cell survival under apoptotic conditions. Stable overexpression of wild-type CD97 reduced serum starvation- and staurosporine-induced intrinsic and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/cycloheximide-induced extrinsic apoptosis, indicated by an increase in cell viability, a lower percentage of cells within the subG0/G1 phase, expressing annexin V, or having condensed nuclei, and a reduction of DNA laddering. Protection from cell death by CD97 was accompanied by an inhibition of caspase activation and modulation of anti- and pro-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 superfamily. shRNA-mediated knockdown of CD97 and, in part, truncation of the seven-span transmembrane (TM7) region of CD97 increased caspase-mediated apoptosis. Protection from apoptosis required not only the TM7 region but also cleavage of the receptor at its GPCR proteolysis site (GPS), whereas alternative splicing of its extracellular domain had no effect. Together, our data indicate a role of CD97 in tumor cell survival.

26120804|t|Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and non-opioids for acute renal colic.
26120804|a|BACKGROUND: Renal colic is acute pain caused by urinary stones. The prevalence of urinary stones is between 10% and 15% in the United States, making renal colic one of the common reasons for urgent urological care. The pain is usually severe and the first step in the management is adequate analgesia. Many different classes of medications have been used in this regard including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotics. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to assess benefits and harms of different NSAIDs and non-opioids in the treatment of adult patients with acute renal colic and if possible to determine which medication (or class of medications) are more appropriate for this purpose. Clinically relevant outcomes such as efficacy of pain relief, time to pain relief, recurrence of pain, need for rescue medication and side effects were explored. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 27 November 2014) through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only randomised or quasi randomised studies were included. Other inclusion criteria included adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of renal colic due to urolithiasis, at least one treatment arm included a non-narcotic analgesic compared to placebo or another non-narcotic drug, and reporting of pain outcome or medication adverse effect. Patient-rated pain by a validated tool, time to relief, need for rescue medication and pain recurrence constituted the outcomes of interest. Any adverse effects (minor or major) reported in the studies were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Abstracts were reviewed by at least two authors independently. Papers meeting the inclusion criteria were fully reviewed and relevant data were recorded in a standardized Cochrane Renal Group data collection form. For dichotomous outcomes relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. For continuous outcomes the weighted mean difference was estimated. Both fixed and random models were used for meta-analysis. We assessed the analgesic effects using four different outcome variables: patient-reported pain relief using a visual analogue scale (VAS); proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction in pain; need for rescue medication; and pain recurrence. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I   test. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 50 studies (5734 participants) were included in this review and 37 studies (4483 participants) contributed to our meta-analyses. Selection bias was low in 34% of the studies or unclear in 66%; performance bias was low in 74%, high in 14% and unclear in 12%; attrition bias was low in 82% and high in 18%; selective reporting bias low in 92% of the studies; and other biases (industry funding) was high in 4%, unclear in 18% and low in 78%.Patient-reported pain (VAS) results varied widely with high heterogeneity observed. For those comparisons which could be pooled we observed the following: NSAIDs significantly reduced pain compared to antispasmodics (5 studies, 303 participants: MD -12.97, 95% CI -21.80 to - 4.14; I   = 74%) and combination therapy of NSAIDs plus antispasmodics was significantly more effective in pain control than NSAID alone (2 studies, 310 participants: MD -1.99, 95% CI -2.58 to -1.40; I   = 0%).NSAIDs were significantly more effective than placebo in reducing pain by 50% within the first hour (3 studies, 197 participants: RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.51; I   = 15%). Indomethacin was found to be less effective than other NSAIDs (4 studies, 412 participants: RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.60; I   = 55%). NSAIDs were significantly more effective than hyoscine in pain reduction (5 comparisons, 196 participants: RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.61 to 3.70; I   = 28%). The combination of NSAIDs and antispasmodics was not superior to NSAIDs only (9 comparisons, 906 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.13; I   = 59%). The results were mixed when NSAIDs were compared to other non-opioid medications.When the need for rescue medication was evaluated, Patients receiving NSAIDs were significantly less likely to require rescue medicine than those receiving placebo (4 comparisons, 180 participants: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.60; I   = 24%) and NSAIDs were more effective than antispasmodics (4 studies, 299 participants: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.84; I   = 65%). Combination of NSAIDs and antispasmodics was not superior to NSAIDs (7 comparisons, 589 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.57; I   = 10%). Indomethacin was less effective than other NSAIDs (4 studies, 517 participants: RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.94; I   = 14%) except for lysine acetyl salicylate (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.65).Pain recurrence was reported by only three studies which could not be pooled: a higher proportion of patients treated with 75 mg diclofenac (IM) showed pain recurrence in the first 24 hours of follow-up compared to those treated with 40 mg piroxicam (IM) (60 participants: RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.81); no significant difference in pain recurrence at 72 hours was observed between piroxicam plus phloroglucinol and piroxicam plus placebo groups (253 participants: RR 2.52, 95% CI 0.15 to12.75); and there was no significant difference in pain recurrence within 72 hours of discharge between IM piroxicam and IV paracetamol (82 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.54).Side effects were presented inconsistently, but no major events were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although due to variability in studies (inclusion criteria, outcome variables and interventions) and the evidence is not of highest quality, we still believe that NSAIDs are an effective treatment for renal colic when compared to placebo or antispasmodics. The addition of antispasmodics to NSAIDS does not result in better pain control. Data on other types of non-opioid, non-NSAID medication was scarce.Major adverse effects are not reported in the literature for the use of NSAIDs for treatment of renal colic.

26100926|t|WHO consultation on Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine Development Report from a World Health Organization Meeting held on 23-24 March 2015.
26100926|a|UNASSIGNED: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally prevalent cause of lower respiratory infection in neonates and infants. Despite its disease burden, a safe and effective RSV vaccine has remained elusive. In recent years, improved understanding of RSV biology and innovations in immunogen design has resulted in the advancement of multiple vaccine candidates into the clinical development pipeline. Given the growing number of vaccines in clinical trials, the rapid pace at which they are being tested, and the likelihood that an RSV vaccine will reach the commercial market in the next 5-10 years, consensus and guidance on clinical development pathways and licensure routes are needed now, before large-scale efficacy trials commence. In pursuit of this aim, the World Health Organization convened the first RSV vaccine consultation in 15 years on the 23rd and 24th of March, 2015 in Geneva, Switzerland. The meeting's primary objective was to provide guidance on clinical endpoints and development pathways for vaccine trials with a focus on considerations of low- and middle-income countries. Meeting participants reached consensus on candidate case definitions for RSV disease, considerations for clinical efficacy endpoints, and the clinical development pathway for active and passive immunization trials in maternal and pediatric populations. The strategic focus of this meeting was on the development of high quality, safe and efficacious RSV preventive interventions for global use and included: (1) maternal/passive immunization to prevent RSV disease in infants less than 6 months; (2) pediatric immunization to prevent RSV disease in infants and young children once protection afforded by maternal immunization wanes.

26116806|t|Effects of Learning Curve on Efficacy of Radiofrequency Ablation for Barrett's Esophagus.
26116806|a|BACKGROUND _ AIMS: Complete eradication of Barrett's esophagus (BE) often requires multiple sessions of radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Little is known about the effects of case volume on the safety and efficacy of RFA, or the presence or contour of learning curves for this procedure. METHODS: We collected data from the US RFA Patient Registry (from 148 institutions) on patients who underwent RFA for BE from July 2007 to July 2011. We analyzed the effects of the number of patients treated by individual endoscopists and individual centers on safety and efficacy outcomes of RFA. Outcomes, including stricture, bleeding, hospitalization, and complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM), were assessed using logistic regression. The effect of center and investigator experience on number of treatment sessions to achieve CEIM was examined using linear regression. RESULTS: After we controlled for potential confounders, we found that as case experience of endoscopists and centers increased, the numbers of treatment sessions required to achieve CEIM decreased. This relationship persisted after adjusting for patient age, sex, race, length of BE, and presence of pretreatment dysplasia (P<.01). Center experience was not significantly associated with overall rates of CEIM or complete eradication of dysplasia. We did not observe any learning curve with regard to risks of stricture, gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or hospitalization (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on an analysis of a large multicenter registry, efficiency of the treatment, as measured by number of sessions needed to achieve CEIM, increased with case volume, indicating a learning curve effect. This trend began to disappear after treatment of approximately 30 patients by the center or individual endoscopist. However, there was no significant association between safety or efficacy outcomes and prior case volume.

26093844|t|Questioning the role of sparse coding in the brain.
26093844|a|UNASSIGNED: Coding principles are central to understanding the organization of brain circuitry. Sparse coding offers several advantages, but a near-consensus has developed that it only has beneficial properties, and these are partially unique to sparse coding. We find that these advantages come at the cost of several trade-offs, with the lower capacity for generalization being especially problematic, and the value of sparse coding as a measure and its experimental support are both questionable. Furthermore, silent synapses and inhibitory interneurons can permit learning speed and memory capacity that was previously ascribed to sparse coding only. Combining these properties without exaggerated sparse coding improves the capacity for generalization and facilitates learning of models of a complex and high-dimensional reality.

26026256|t|Partial dissociation in the neural bases of VSTM and imagery in the early visual cortex.
26026256|a|UNASSIGNED: Visual short-term memory (VSTM) and visual imagery are believed to involve overlapping neuronal representations in the early visual cortex. While a number of studies have provided evidence for this overlap, at the behavioral level VSTM and imagery are dissociable processes; this begs the question of how their neuronal mechanisms differ. Here we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine whether the neural bases of imagery and VSTM maintenance are dissociable in the early visual cortex (EVC). We intentionally used a similar task for VSTM and imagery in order to equate their assessment. We hypothesized that any differential effect of TMS on VSTM and imagery would indicate that their neuronal bases differ at the level of EVC. In the "alone" condition, participants were asked to engage either in VSTM or imagery, whereas in the "concurrent" condition, each trial required both VSTM maintenance and imagery simultaneously. A dissociation between VSTM and imagery was observed for reaction times: TMS slowed down responses for VSTM but not for imagery. The impact of TMS on sensitivity did not differ between VSTM and imagery, but did depend on whether the tasks were carried concurrently or alone. This study shows that neural processes associated with VSTM and imagery in the early visual cortex can be partially dissociated.

26093607|t|The Disease Ontology: fostering interoperability between biological and clinical human disease-related data.
26093607|a|UNASSIGNED: The Disease Ontology (DO) enables cross-domain data integration through a common standard of human disease terms and their etiological descriptions. Standardized disease descriptors that are integrated across mammalian genomic resources provide a human-readable, machine-interpretable, community-driven disease corpus that unifies the representation of human common and rare diseases. The DO is populated by consensus-driven disease data descriptors that incorporate disease terms utilized by genomic and genetic projects and resources engaged in studies to understand the genetics of human disease through the study of model organisms. The DO project serves multiple roles for the model organism community by providing: (1) a structured "backbone" of disease concepts represented among the model organism databases; (2) authoritative disease curation services to researchers and resource providers; and (3) development of subsets of the DO representative of human diseases annotated to animal models curated within the model organism databases.

26051854|t|[Place of clinical pharmacist in the management of drugs in patients with hypertension].
26051854|a|PURPOSE: To synthesize pharmacists' interventions made in the department of internal medicine and hypertension of university hospital of Toulouse and assess the impact on medication orders. METHODS: This is a single-center, prospective study using pharmacists' interventions recorded between September 2013 and March 2014 on the Act-IP(  ) website of the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy. The clinical pharmacist is present everyday in the unit to establish the medication reconciliation of new patients (the process of comparing a patient's medication orders to all of the medications that the patient has been taking), and analysis of medication orders. When a risk of iatrogenic drug is identified, a therapeutic change is proposed to the prescriber. RESULTS: A total of 2491 medication orders were analyzed for 7 months, leading to 39 pharmacists' interventions (1.6 pharmacists' interventions per 100 medication orders). The most commonly identified drug-related problems were improper administration (33%, n=13), not prescribed drug (21%, n=8), non-conformity to guidelines (18%, n=7), supratherapeutic dose (15%, n=6), and 13% (n=5) targeted prescribed treatment not administered, underdosing, incorrect administration or drug interaction. The most relevant molecules were atorvastatin (10%), bromazepam (8%) and levothyroxine (8%) and only 2 interventions targeted antihypertensive drugs. The rate of physicians' acceptance was 92%. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists' interventions mainly concern the co-prescriptions of antihypertensive drugs and very few antihypertensive drugs. The clinical pharmacist contributes to preventing iatrogenic in patients with hypertension with a very good acceptance by the clinician.

26117372|t|Urban wastewater treatment by seven species of microalgae and an  algal bloom: Biomass production, N and P removal kinetics and  harvestability.
26117372|a|UNASSIGNED: This study evaluates the capacity of seven species and a Bloom of microalgae to grow in urban wastewater. Nutrient removal kinetics and biomass harvesting by means of centrifugation and coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation have been also tested. Results show that the best biomass productivities ranged from between 118 and 108  mgSS  L(-1)  d(-1) for the Bloom (Bl) and Scenedesmus obliquus (Sco). Regarding nutrient removal, microalgae were able to remove the total dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations by more than 80% and 87% respectively, depending on the species tested. The final total dissolved concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in the culture media complies with the European Commission Directive 98/15/CE on urban wastewater treatment. Regarding harvesting, the results of coagulation-flocculation sedimentation using a 60  mg  L(-1) dose of Ferric chloride were similar between species, exceeding the biomass removal efficiency by more than 90%. The results of centrifugation (time required to remove 90% of solids at 1000  rpm) were not similar between species, with the shortest time being 2.9  min for Sco, followed by the bloom (7.25  min). An overall analysis suggested that the natural bloom and Scenedesmus obliquus seem to be the best candidates to grow in pre-treated wastewater, according to their biomass production, nutrient removal capability and harvestability.

26073003|t|A norovirus GII.P21 outbreak in a boarding school, Austria 2014.
26073003|a|OBJECTIVES: An Austrian boarding school reported a cluster of gastroenteritis on January 10, 2014. Environmental swabs from the school cafeteria and a nearby kebab restaurant tested positive for norovirus. The outbreak was investigated to identify its source(s). METHODS: An outbreak case was defined as a student or staff member with diarrhoea or vomiting that developed between January 7 and 13. Details on food exposure were collected via a self-administered questionnaire; risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Norovirus from the stool specimens of cases and asymptomatic kebab restaurant workers were genotyped. RESULTS: Twenty-eight cases were identified among 144 persons (attack rate 19%). The outbreak emerged and peaked on January 9, and ended on January 12. Compared to those who did not eat kebab, those who ate kebab on 7, 8, and 9 January were respectively 11 (95% CI 4.2-28), 6.7 (95% CI 3.4-13), and 9.3 (95% CI 4.0-22) times more likely to develop disease within the following 2 days. Stool specimens from three cases and three restaurant workers were positive for norovirus GII.P21. CONCLUSIONS: The kebab prepared by norovirus-positive restaurant workers was the most likely source of the outbreak. It is recommended that food handlers comply strictly with hand hygiene and avoid bare-handed contact with ready-to-eat food to minimize the risk of food-borne infection.

26079111|t|Differential relationships between D1 and D2 dopamine receptor expression in the medial preoptic nucleus and sexually-motivated song in male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris).
26079111|a|UNASSIGNED: Converging data in songbirds support a central role for the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) in motivational aspects of vocal production. Recent data suggest that dopamine in the POM plays a complex modulatory role in the production of sexually-motivated song and that an optimal level of dopamine D1 receptor stimulation is required to facilitate singing behavior. To further explore this possibility, we used quantitative real-time PCR to examine relationships between mRNA expression of D1 as well as D2 receptors in the POM (and also the lateral septum and Area X) and sexually-motivated singing behavior in male European starlings. Results showed that both males with the highest and lowest D1 expression in the POM sang significantly less than males with intermediate levels of expression. Furthermore, singing behavior rose linearly in association with increasing levels of D1 expression in POM but dropped abruptly, such that individuals with D1 expression values higher than the mean sang very little. Analysis of birds with low and intermediate levels of D1 expression in POM revealed strong positive correlations between D1 expression and song but negative relationships between D2 receptor expression and song. These findings support prior work suggesting an optimal level of POM D1 receptor stimulation best facilitates sexually-motivated singing behavior. Results also suggest that D2 receptors may work in opposition to D1 receptors in POM to modify vocal production.

26116121|t|Immuno-PET of epithelial ovarian cancer: harnessing the potential of CA125 for non-invasive imaging.
26116121|a|BACKGROUND: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is characterized by the overexpression of cancer antigen 125 (CA125), a mucinous glycoprotein that serves as a tumor biomarker. Early diagnosis of EOC is plagued by its asymptomatic nature of progression and the limitations of currently used immunoassay techniques that detect CA125 as a shed antigen in serum samples. Presently, there is no technique available for the in vivo evaluation of CA125 expression in malignant tissues. Moreover, there could be an unexplored pathophysiological time window for the detection of CA125 in EOC, during which it is expressed on tumor cells prior to being shed into the bloodstream. A method for the in vivo evaluation of CA125 expression on ovarian neoplasms earlier along disease progression and/or recurrence can potentially contribute to better disease management. To this end, the present work utilizes an anti-CA125 monoclonal antibody (MAb) and a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) labeled with the positron-emitting radionuclide (64)Cu for preclinical molecular imaging of CA125 expression in vivo. METHODS: Anti-CA125 MAb and scFv were prepared and functionally characterized for target binding prior to being tested as radiotracers in a preclinical setting. RESULTS: Immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry revealed specific binding of CA125-targeting vectors to NIH:OVCAR-3 cells and no binding to antigen-negative SKOV3 cells. (64)Cu-labeled anti-CA125 MAb and scFv were obtained in specific activities of 296 and 122  MBq/mg, respectively. Both radioimmunoconjugate vectors demonstrated highly selective binding to NIH:OVCAR-3 cells and virtually no binding to SKOV3 cells. In vivo radiopharmacological evaluation using xenograft mouse models injected with (64)Cu-labeled anti-CA125 MAb provided a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 5.76 (29.70 %ID/g) in OVCAR3 tumors 24  h post-injection (p.i.) versus 1.80 (5.91 %ID/g) in SKOV3 tumors. (64)Cu-labeled anti-CA125 scFv provided an SUV of 0.64 (3.21 %ID/g) in OVCAR3 tumors 24  h p.i. versus 0.25 (1.49 %ID/g) in SKOV3 tumors. Results from small-animal PET imaging were confirmed by ex vivo autoradiography and immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSIONS: Radiolabeling of anti-CA125 MAb and scFv with (64)Cu did not compromise their immunoreactivity. Both radioimmunoconjugates presented specific tumor uptake and expected biological clearance profiles. This renders them as potential immuno-PET probes for targeted in vivo molecular imaging of CA125 in EOC.

26069728|t|Non-contact radiofrequency-induced reduction of subcutaneous abdominal fat correlates with initial cardiovascular autonomic balance and fat tissue hormones: safety analysis.
26069728|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The non-invasive reduction of subcutaneous abdominal fat became popular in the last decade. Radiofrequency (RF), non-contact, selective-field device Vanquish   has been developed to selectively induce deep fat tissue heating to reduce waist circumference. Our analysis evaluates immediate and sustained effects of this treatment on cardiovascular autonomic function and on selected metabolic parameters. Study design/ patients and methods: A retrospective proof-of-concept analysis of RF treatment effects was conducted in 20 individuals with metabolic syndrome, to reduce the subcutaneous abdominal fat. Four 30-minutes treatment sessions (manufacturer  s standard protocol) were performed in 1-week intervals. Vital signs, ECG, lab screening, body composition, subcutaneous fat thickness and spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) have been examined before, after the 1 (st) and 4 (th) treatment, and at follow-up visits 1 month and 3 months after the treatment. RESULTS: The RF treatment led to a significant reduction of abdominal circumference after the 4 (th) session (p<0.001), and during follow-up after 1 and 3 months (p<0.001 and p<0.02, resp.). There was a significant correlation (r=-0.58, p=0.007) between reduction of abdominal circumference and initial very-low frequency (VLF) spectral power at 1 month follow-up. A significant increase of cumulative spectral power in low frequency (p=0.02) and reduction in high frequency (p=0.05) band have been observed immediately (20 +14 minutes) after the treatment. On the contrary, no sustained impact on autonomic balance has been recorded 39 +18 days after the treatment. A significant correlation between the initial adiponectin values and immediate autonomic response to one treatment was observed in VLF and total spectral bands (r>0.59, p<0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that the selective-field RF treatment is safe and efficient for reduction of subcutaneous abdominal fat. While the treatment increases the immediate sympathetic response of the body to deep tissue heating, no sustained change in autonomic function could be recorded at 1 month follow-up. The observed correlation between initial VLF spectral power and waist circumference reduction at follow-up, as well as the association of initial adiponectin values and immediate autonomic response to the treatment might be instrumental for decisions on body contouring strategies.

26069547|t|Diagnostic Modalities for Diseased Articular Cartilage-From Defect to Degeneration: A Review.
26069547|a|The progression of cartilage matrix damage to generalized degeneration is associated with specific pathophysiological and clinical aspects. Reliable detection of stage-related characteristics of cartilage disease serves both a therapeutic and prognostic goal. Over the past years, several (pre)clinical diagnostic modalities for cartilage pathologies have been advocated. Each modality focuses on different aspects of the disease. Early diagnosis, before irreversible damage has occurred, opens up the possibility for better treatment and improves the patients' prognosis. This article gives an overview of the diagnostic modalities available for monitoring cartilage pathology and focuses on reliability, clinical value, current status, and possible applications.

26069766|t|Regional citrate anticoagulation for slow continuous ultrafiltration: risk of severe metabolic alkalosis.
26069766|a|BACKGROUND: Slow continuous ultrafiltration (SCUF) is a safe and efficient treatment for fluid overload in patients who are hemodynamically unstable, have low urine output, and are not in need of dialysis or hemofiltration for solute clearance. Sustained anticoagulation is required for these long treatments, thus posing clinically challenges for patients having contraindications to systemic anticoagulation with heparin. Regional citrate anticoagulation would be an alternative option; however, we believed that this would be problematic due to citrate kinetics that predicted the development of metabolic alkalosis. METHODS: In that patients' serum bicarbonate reached 45 mEq/L and arterial pH rose to 7.59 after just 3 days of SCUF, we developed equations to study this phenomenon. We report here the acid-base balance calculations quantifying base accumulation in SCUF compared to continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). RESULTS: This kinetic approach demonstrates the importance of accounting for the high citrate clearance into CVVH hemofiltrate, which prevents development of the alkalosis seen with the relatively low ultrafiltration rates in SCUF: there was net bicarbonate accumulation of    1400 mmol/day with SCUF, compared to 664 to as low as 274 mmol/day during CVVH. The calculations underscore the importance of the relative fluid flow rates as well as the bicarbonate and citrate levels in the various infused solutions. We also discuss how citrate's acid-base effects are potentially complicated by metabolism via gluconeogenic and ketone body pathways. CONCLUSIONS: These acid-base balance findings emphasize why clinicians must be mindful of the risk of metabolic alkalosis when using continuous renal replacement therapy modalities with low rates of ultrafiltration, which thereby presents a contraindication for using citrate anticoagulation for SCUF.

26007311|t|Skin-to-Skin Care and the Development of the Preterm Infant Oral Microbiome.
26007311|a|UNASSIGNED: Objective   The oral cavity represents an initial entry way for oral and gut indigenous colonization. Skin-to-skin (STS) care, in which the mother holds the diaper clad naked preterm (PT) infant between her breasts, is associated with improved digestive function, decreased stress, and improved survival. This study evaluated the development of oral microbial colonization repertoires and health characteristics in PT infants with or without STS exposure. Methods   Saliva from 42 PT infants (<32 weeks of gestation at birth) was collected prospectively at 1   month and/or at discharge. High-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing identified microbial diversity and prevalence of bacterial signatures correlated with clinical STS or non-STS care. Results   Corrected for gestational age (CGA) at sampling, bacterial taxa demonstrated increased Streptococcus as a signature of oral repertoire maturation. STS was associated with increased Streptococcus (p   <   0.024), while non-STS was associated with greater Corynebacterium (p   <   0.023) and Pseudomonas (p   <   0.019) in infants    <=   32 weeks CGA. In infants   >   32 weeks CGA, Neisseria and Acinetobacter were more prevalent, 50 vs. 16.7% and 40 vs. 0%, respectively. STS care was associated with shorter hospitalization (p   <   0.039). Conclusion   STS care during earlier gestation was associated with a distinct microbial pattern and an accelerated pace of oral microbial repertoire maturity.

26011825|t|Duration of ruptured membranes and mother-to-child HIV transmission: a prospective population-based surveillance study.
26011825|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between duration of rupture of membranes (ROM) and mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT) rates in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). DESIGN: The National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood (NSHPC) undertakes comprehensive population-based surveillance of HIV in pregnant women and children. SETTING: UK and Ireland. POPULATION: A cohort of 2398 singleton pregnancies delivered vaginally, or by emergency caesarean section, in women on cART in pregnancy during the period 2007-2012 with information on duration of ROM; HIV infection status was available for 1898 infants. METHODS: Descriptive analysis of NSHPC data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of MTCT. RESULTS: In 2116 pregnancies delivered at term, the median duration of ROM was 3  hours 30  minutes (interquartile range, IQR 1-8  hours). The overall MTCT rate for women delivering at term with duration of ROM >= 4  hours was 0.64% compared with 0.34% for ROM <4  hours, with no significant difference between the groups (OR  1.90, 95%  CI 0.45-7.97). In women delivering at term with a viral load of <50  copies/ml, there was no evidence of a difference in MTCT rates with duration of ROM >= 4  hours, compared with <4  hours (0.14% for >= 4  hours versus 0.12% for <4  hour; OR  1.14, 95%  CI 0.07-18.27). Among infants born preterm with infection status available, there were no transmissions in 163 deliveries where the maternal viral load was <50  copies/ml. CONCLUSIONS: No association was found between duration of ROM and MTCT in women taking cART. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Rupture of membranes of more than 4 hours is not associated with MTCT of HIV in women on effective ART delivering at term.

26085901|t|Demonstrating Value for Biosimilars: A Conceptual Framework.
26085901|a|BACKGROUND: The value proposition for biosimilars can be characterized as a concept that moves beyond the argument of cost reduction relative to the innovator biologic drug and into a framework that incorporates the diverse needs of key healthcare stakeholders during the transition from clinical development to commercialization in the marketplace. OBJECTIVES: To identify factors that facilitate and inhibit the development, commercialization, and adoption of biosimilars, and to recommend modifications in program design that are likely to support the demonstration of the value of biosimilars for payers, providers, and patients. METHODS: The primary data sources for this article include surveys conducted by Boston Healthcare Associates with payers and clinicians in the United States and the European Union 5 markets and blinded international protocol feasibility assessments completed by Worldwide Clinical Trials. Survey methodology used either convenience or purposeful sampling as appropriate, with participants extracted from diverse audiences, representative of those who generate or evaluate clinical data shaping the economic exchange and preferential status influencing physician adoption and patient access to biosimilars. Patient characteristics and psychosocial issues influencing patients' perception of small-molecule generics were extracted from the available literature to inform exploratory hypotheses, given the relative absence of such information for biosimilars. DISCUSSION: This article reviews the current evidence and summarizes results of surveys conducted with payers, providers, and drug investigation sites in the United States. Based on a review of published literature, as well as these survey results, conflicting and convergent demands exist for gathering data related to biosimilars. The motivations and data needs for these new agents are diverse, requiring adjudication of regulatory, economic, and clinical incentives beginning at program inception and extending through commercialization of the final biosimilar agent. CONCLUSIONS: The development and commercialization of biosimilars represent an international activity that can encounter unanticipated challenges, as well as opportunities to achieve clinical and commercial success. Evolving regulatory guidance mapped in relation to payer, physician, and patient sentiments may inform the biosimilar development program designs, implementation, and positioning of the new drug.

26085316|t|Larvicidal activity of Magnolia denudata seed hydrodistillate constituents and related compounds and liquid formulations towards two susceptible and two wild mosquito species.
26085316|a|BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens pallens mosquitoes transmit malaria, dengue fever and West Nile virus diseases, respectively. This study was conducted to determine the toxicity of 17 constituents from Magnolia denudata seed hydrodistillate (MD-SHD) and four experimental MD-SHD liquid formulations (10-50   mg   L(-1) liquids) to third instar larvae from insecticide-susceptible Cx, p. pallens and Ae. aegypti as well as wild Ae. albopictus and An. sinensis. RESULTS: 2, 4-Di-tert-butylphenol was the most toxic constituent (LC50 , 1.98-3.90   mg   L(-1) ), followed by linoleic acid (7.19-10.49   mg   L(-1) ) towards four mosquito species larvae. High toxicity was also produced by nerolidol, (  )-limonene, a-terpinene and y-terpinene (LC50 , 9.84-36.42   mg   L(-1) ). The toxicity of these compounds was virtually identical towards four mosquito species larvae, even though An. sinensis larvae were resistant to deltamethrin and temephos. The MS-SHD 50   mg   L(-1) liquid resulted in 92-100% control towards four mosquito species larvae while commercial temephos 200   g   L(-1) emulsifiable concentrate was almost ineffective towards An. sinensis larvae (30% mortality). CONCLUSION: Reasonable mosquito control in the aquatic environment can be achieved by MD-SHD 50   mg   L(-1) liquid as a potential larvicide.

26011342|t|Molecular and clinico-histological data in aggressive prostate cancer patients from Bulgaria.
26011342|a|PURPOSE: Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading causes of death in men worldwide. We report Bulgarian patients with strongly aggressive, castration-resistant PCa. METHODS: PCA3 overexpression, GSTP1 promoter hyper-methylation, TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions, IVS1-27G>A in the KLF6 gene and mutations in androgen receptor (AR) gene, for diagnostic purposes were assessed. PCR, real-time PCR (RT-PCR), sequencing, and bisulfite conversion of DNA were applied. We correlated the molecular data to the histological and clinical findings. RESULTS: The obtained molecular profile in 11 PCa Bulgarian patients coincided with the clinico-histological data of strongly aggressive PCa. Association was detected between the tumor stage (assessed by TNM as T3 and T4) and the detected molecular profile of aggressive cancer behavior with one exception, assessed as T2. None of our patients had positive family history of prostate cancer and no somatic mutations were detected in the AR gene. All patients showed normal genotype with respect to the KLF6 IVS1- 27G>A polymorphism. The rest of the markers were positive in fresh prostatic tissues and biopsies from all patients, whereas only one blood sample showed triple positive result. CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of PCa-specific markers in blood was considered as a predictor for a PCa (micro) dissemination into the circulation. The GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation is the earliest epigenetic alteration, which indicates cancerous changes and the first and long-lasting marker that is detectable in blood circulation. The molecular profile needs to be strictly monitored during treatment, which is of great help in determining the patient's individual response to therapy.

26017059|t|Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor of the Lower Eyelid: Case Presentation and Literature Review.
26017059|a|UNASSIGNED: Solitary benign neurogenic tumors are common in the orbit, but only rarely arise from peripheral nerves in the eyelids. In contrast, malignant tumors of neural or nerve sheath elements are exceedingly rare in the orbit and, to date, have never been reported in the lower eyelid. The authors report a 55-year-old man with multiple recurrent lower eyelid masses initially treated as chalazia then misdiagnosed as neurotropic malignant melanoma on pathology. Diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor was ultimately confirmed histopathologically after surgical resection. The patient has since undergone multiple resections and adjuvant radiotherapy. Twenty-two months since the last procedure, the patient remains disease-free.

26020509|t|MiRNA Profiles in Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines of Finnish Prostate Cancer Families.
26020509|a|BACKGROUND: Heritable factors are evidently involved in prostate cancer (PrCa) carcinogenesis, but currently, genetic markers are not routinely used in screening or diagnostics of the disease. More precise information is needed for making treatment decisions to distinguish aggressive cases from indolent disease, for which heritable factors could be a useful tool. The genetic makeup of PrCa has only recently begun to be unravelled through large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The thus far identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) explain, however, only a fraction of familial clustering. Moreover, the known risk SNPs are not associated with the clinical outcome of the disease, such as aggressive or metastasised disease, and therefore cannot be used to predict the prognosis. Annotating the SNPs with deep clinical data together with miRNA expression profiles can improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of different phenotypes of prostate cancer. RESULTS: In this study microRNA (miRNA) profiles were studied as potential biomarkers to predict the disease outcome. The study subjects were from Finnish high risk prostate cancer families. To identify potential biomarkers we combined a novel non-parametrical test with an importance measure provided from a Random Forest classifier. This combination delivered a set of nine miRNAs that was able to separate cases from controls. The detected miRNA expression profiles could predict the development of the disease years before the actual PrCa diagnosis or detect the existence of other cancers in the studied individuals. Furthermore, using an expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) analysis, regulatory SNPs for miRNA miR-483-3p that were also directly associated with PrCa were found. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, we suggest that blood-based miRNA expression profiling can be used in the diagnosis and maybe even prognosis of the disease. In the future, miRNA profiling could possibly be used in targeted screening, together with Prostate Specific Antigene (PSA) testing, to identify men with an elevated PrCa risk.

26016036|t|[Influence of transcranial electromagnetic brain stimulation on development of conditioned reflex in rats].
26016036|a|The influence of transcranial electromagnetic stimulation on the development of an active avoidance reflex with painful reinforcement in laboratory rats is investigated. It is shown, that an exposure of the rats' brain to electromagnetic radiation in the millimeter range ((   = 5,6 and 7,1 mm), modulated as a series of low-frequency pulses, leads to a suppression of the development of the conditioned avoidance reflex occurred in 50% of cases. In other 25% of cases irradiation leads to inhibition of reflex development. Transcranial electromagnetic stimulation after intraperitoneal injection of the blocking agent of serotonergic receptors (kitryl) has no influence on reflex development. Electromagnetic brain stimulation does not influence reflex retention in the case when it has been acquired. Based on the data obtained it is assumed that transcranial electromagnetic stimulation promotes the development of serotonin, exerting an inhibiting effect on the formation of temporal bindings of the studied conditioned reflex.

26027706|t|Workflow interruptions, social stressors from supervisor (s) and attention failure in surgery personnel.
26027706|a|UNASSIGNED: Workflow interruptions and social stressors among surgery personnel may cause attention failure at work that may increase rumination about work issues during leisure time. The test of these assumptions should contribute to the understanding of exhaustion in surgery personnel and patient safety. Workflow interruptions and supervisor-related social stressors were tested to predict attention failure that predicts work-related rumination during leisure time. One hundred ninety-four theatre nurses, anaesthetists and surgeons from a Swiss University hospital participated in a cross-sectional survey. The participation rate was 58 percent. Structural equation modelling confirmed both indirect paths from workflow interruptions and social stressors via attention failure on rumination (both p<0.05). An alternative model, assuming the reversed indirect causation-from attention failure via workflow interruptions and social stressors on rumination-could not be empirically supported. Workflow interruptions and social stressors at work are likely to trigger attention failure in surgery personnel. Work redesign and team intervention could help surgery personnel to maintain a high level of quality and patient safety and detach from work related issues to recover during leisure time.

26028755|t|Characterization of pomegranate juice and whey based novel beverage fermented by kefir grains.
26028755|a|Mixture of pomegranate juice and whey was evaluated as a potential substrate for production of a novel probiotic beverage by kefir grains. Different fermentation conditions were used as viz: two fermentation temperature (19     C and 25     C) and two levels of kefir grains inoculum (5  % and 8%w/v). pH, acidity, lactose consumption as well as organic acids formation were determined during 32  hours of fermentation. Results showed that kefir grains were able to utilize lactose and decrease pH, increase acidity, produce lactic acid and acetic acid, while the level of citric acid decreased. It was observed these change depended on temperature and level of kefir grains with the highest changes at the temperature of 25     C and kefir grains inoculum of 8%w/v. Pomegranate juice and whey mixture therefore may serve as a suitable substrate for the production of novel probiotic dairy-fruit juice beverage by kefir grains and the sensory characteristics of this beverage were shown desirable results.

26030555|t|Miniaturized fiber-coupled confocal fluorescence microscope with an electrowetting variable focus lens using no moving parts.
26030555|a|UNASSIGNED: We report a miniature, lightweight fiber-coupled confocal fluorescence microscope that incorporates an electrowetting variable focus lens to provide axial scanning for full three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Lateral scanning is accomplished by coupling our device to a laser-scanning confocal microscope through a coherent imaging fiber-bundle. The optical components of the device are combined in a custom 3D-printed adapter with an assembled weight of <2      g that can be mounted onto the head of a mouse. Confocal sectioning provides an axial resolution of    12       m and an axial scan range of    80       m. The lateral field-of-view is 300   m, and the lateral resolution is 1.8   m. We determined these parameters by imaging fixed sections of mouse neuronal tissue labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and fluorescent bead samples in agarose gel. To demonstrate viability for imaging intact tissue, we resolved multiple optical sections of ex vivo mouse olfactory nerve fibers expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP).

26028786|t|A useful methoxyvinyl cation equivalent: a-t-butyldimethylsilyl-a-methoxyacetaldehyde.
26028786|a|UNASSIGNED: Described are the synthesis and application of a-t-butyldimethylsilyl-a-methoxyacetaldehyde as a formal methoxyvinyl cation equivalent. Addition of Grignard reagents to the title aldehyde, followed by treatment of the intermediate b-hydroxysilanes with KH, gives good yields of large Z-methoxyvinylated products. Assuming a Peterson-like elimination mechanism, one can infer that the Grignard addition proceeds with high syn selectivity. These results are consistent with a chelation control model involving coordination to the a-methoxy group in the title aldehyde rather than an alternative stereoelectronic Felkin-Anh-type model. It must be noted that a steric Felkin-Anh model also accounts for the observed stereochemistry. All told, the title reagent can be employed to efficiently append a Z-configured methoxyvinyl group to an appropriate R-M species, in two steps.

26044360|t|Involvement of electron and hydrogen transfers through redox metabolism on activity and toxicity of the nimesulide.
26044360|a|An electronic study of nimesulide was performed by using density functional theory calculations. The activities of the six different derivatives were related with electron donating or accepting capacities. All compounds which had nitro moiety had low electron donating and high electron accepting capacities. However, the reduced derivative of nimesulide have more electron donating capacity than other compounds. The highest spin density contribution in nitro and lowest spin density contribution on phenoxyl moieties can be related with preferential metabolism by reduction when compared with the oxidation. The redox behavior between nitro and amino groups can be related with anti-inflammatory mechanism of nimesulide. These results explain the redox influence of nitro moiety on biological metabolism and mechanism of nimesulide. Graphical Abstract Electron and hydrogen transfers on redox metabolism of nimesulide.

26045023|t|The Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) as a Predictive Marker of Peritoneal Dissemination in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Patients.
26045023|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the efficacy of the risk of ovarian malignancy algorithm (ROMA), calculated using the carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) and human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) levels and the menopausal status, as a predictor of peritoneal dissemination in ovarian cancer. METHODS: The CA125 and HE4 levels and the ROMA were compared between ovarian cancer patients (n = 122) with or without peritoneal dissemination. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated, and the results were compared with those of computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: The CA125, HE4, and ROMA values differed significantly depending on the presence of peritoneal dissemination (p < 0.0001). The cut-off values were 181 U/ml for CA125, 161 pmol/ml for HE4, 44% for the ROMA (premenopausal), and 86% for the ROMA (postmenopausal). Among these markers, the ROMA (premenopausal) was the strongest predictor of peritoneal dissemination, with a specificity of 85.0% and a positive predictive value of 81.3%. In addition, the detection rates of small disseminations with less than 2 cm in diameter for the ROMA (93%) and HE4 (60%) were superior to that of CT (53%). CONCLUSIONS: The ROMA was a significant predictor of peritoneal dissemination and may be superior to CT for the detection of patients with small disseminations.    2015 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg.

26053790|t|Tactile processing in children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
26053790|a|UNASSIGNED: Many obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients experience sensory phenomena, such as bodily sensations and "just-right" perceptions accompanying compulsions. We studied tactile processing in OCD by psychophysical experiments targeting the somatosensory cortex. Thirty-two children and adolescents with OCD (8 tic-related, 19 with sensory phenomena (SP)) and their sex- and age-matched controls participated in the study. After clinical assessments, two questionnaires were completed for sensory problems (Sensory Profile and Touch Inventory for Elementary-School-Aged Children). The psychophysical experiments consisted of five tasks: simple reaction time, choice reaction time, dynamic (detection) threshold, amplitude discrimination, and amplitude discrimination with single-site adaptation. The tactile stimuli were sinusoidal mechanical vibrations (frequency: 25   Hz) applied on the fingertips. Just-noticeable differences (JNDs) were found in amplitude discrimination tasks. There was no difference between the OCD group and controls in detection thresholds. However, the OCD group (especially young males) had worse amplitude discrimination (i.e., higher JNDs) than controls. Young OCD participants had reduced adaptation than young controls. Tic-related OCD participants and those with SP had higher detection thresholds than those without. Additionally, the OCD group reported more problems than controls in the Emotional/Social subset of the Sensory Profile questionnaire. The discrimination results show altered tactile processing in OCD at suprathreshold levels. This can be explained by a scaling factor modifying the sensory signal with decreasing slope at higher input levels to achieve normal Weber fractions internally. Quadratic discriminant analysis gave the best positive (76%) and negative (60%) predictive values for classifying individuals (into "OCD" or "control" groups) based on psychophysical data alone.

26053616|t|NF-kBp65 and Expression of Its Pro-Inflammatory Target Genes Are Upregulated in the Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue of Cachectic Cancer Patients.
26053616|a|UNASSIGNED: Cancer cachexia, of which the most notable symptom is severe and rapid weight loss, is present in the majority of patients with advanced cancer. Inflammatory mediators play an important role in the development of cachexia, envisaged as a chronic inflammatory syndrome. The white adipose tissue (WAT) is one of the first compartments affected in cancer cachexia and suffers a high rate of lipolysis. It secretes several cytokines capable of directly regulating intermediate metabolism. A common pathway in the regulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in WAT is the activation of the nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-kB). We have examined the gene expression of the subunits NF-kBp65 and NF-kBp50, as well as NF-kBp65 and NF-kBp50 binding, the gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators under NF-kB control (IL-1b, IL-6, INF-y, TNF-a, MCP-1), and its inhibitory protein, nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (IkB-a). The observational study involved 35 patients (control group, n = 12 and cancer group, n = 23, further divided into cachectic and non-cachectic). NF-kBp65 and its target genes expression (TNF-a, IL-1b, MCP-1 and IkB-a) were significantly higher in cachectic cancer patients. Moreover, NF-kBp65 gene expression correlated positively with the expression of its target genes. The results strongly suggest that the NF-kB pathway plays a role in the promotion of WAT inflammation during cachexia.

26051799|t|Microbiology and antibiotic resistance in severe burns patients: A 5 year review in an adult burns unit.
26051799|a|BACKGROUND: Infections are a major problem in burns patients. Knowledge of the incidence and antimicrobial sensitivities of the microorganisms commonly encountered within each institution's burns unit is important as it informs and directs empiric antibiotic therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients admitted from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012 to an adult burns intensive care unit. Specimens chosen for analysis were wound swabs, blood cultures, venous catheter tips, tracheal aspirates, sputum, urine and wound tissue. Records were accessed from the admission register and laboratory information system to obtain the relevant data. RESULTS: During the study period, 352 patients were admitted to the adult burns intensive care unit, of which, 341 patients were included. The mortality rate was 44.6%. Flame burns were the commonest. Mortality rate amongst patients with bacteremia was 46.9%. Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were found to be the most common organisms cultured in most specimens. CONCLUSION: The main three organisms identified in specimen cultures in our adult burns intensive care unit were A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa and MRSA. This study has helped establish a better empiric approach to the management of our septic burns patients.

However, with aging, this aspect may appear to everybody. The melanin heterochromia has various origins including ethnicity, the hormonal impact, the influence of various inflammatory, toxic and drug-induced disorders, as well as the impact of photoaging. The cheetah-look aspect is thus established and well identified under ultraviolet light or using an ingenious trick selecting some wavelengths of visible light.

26055730|t|Mouse embryonic stem cells with a multi-integrase mouse artificial chromosome for transchromosomic mouse generation.
26055730|a|UNASSIGNED: The mouse artificial chromosome (MAC) has several advantages as a gene delivery vector, including stable episomal maintenance of the exogenous genetic material and the ability to carry large and/or multiple gene inserts including their regulatory elements. Previously, a MAC containing multi-integration site (MI-MAC) was generated to facilitate transfer of multiple genes into desired cells. To generate transchromosomic (Tc) mice containing a MI-MAC with genes of interest, the desired genes were inserted into MI-MAC in CHO cells, and then the MI-MAC was transferred to mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT). However, the efficiency of MMCT from CHO to mES cells is very low (<10(-6)). In this study, we constructed mES cell lines containing a MI-MAC vector to directly insert a gene of interest into the MI-MAC in mES cells via a simple transfection method for Tc mouse generation. The recombination rate of the GFP gene at each attachment site (FRT, PhiC31attP, R4attP, TP901-1attP and Bxb1attP) on MI-MAC was greater than 50  % in MI-MAC mES cells. Chimeric mice with high coat colour chimerism were generated from the MI-MAC mES cell lines and germline transmission from the chimera was observed. As an example for the generation of Tc mice with a desired gene by the MI-MAC mES approach, a Tc mouse strain ubiquitously expressing Emerald luciferase was efficiently established. Thus, the findings suggest that this new Tc strategy employing mES cells and a MI-MAC vector is efficient and useful for animal transgenesis.

26055618|a|UNASSIGNED: The angular-shaped n-type semiconductors 2-(12H-dibenzofluoren-12-ylidene)malononitrilediimide 2a and 2b were successfully designed, synthesized, and fully characterized by optical absorption and fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, X-ray crystal structure analysis, XRD, and OFET device performance. The varying alkyl chain lengths of 2a and 2b caused different molecular orientations with respect to the substrate. Thus, 2a presents an electron mobility of 0.01 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1), whereas 2b resulted in poor device performance with a much lower electron mobility of 5 * 10(-4) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1).

26073984|t|Activation and Function of iNKT and MAIT Cells.
26073984|a|Over the last two decades, it has been established that peptides are not the only antigens recognized by T lymphocytes. Here, we review information on two T lymphocyte populations that recognize nonpeptide antigens: invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells), which respond to glycolipids, and mucosal associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells), which recognize microbial metabolites. These two populations have a number of striking properties that distinguish them from the majority of T cells. First, their cognate antigens are presented by nonclassical class I antigen-presenting molecules; CD1d for iNKT cells and MR1 for MAIT cells. Second, these T lymphocyte populations have a highly restricted diversity of their T cell antigen receptor a chains. Third, these cells respond rapidly to antigen or cytokine stimulation by producing copious amounts of cytokines, such as IFNy, which normally are only made by highly differentiated effector T lymphocytes. Because of their response characteristics, iNKT and MAIT cells act at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity, participating in both types of responses. In this review, we will compare these two subsets of innate-like T cells, with an emphasis on the various ways that lead to their activation and their participation in antimicrobial responses.

26073766|t|Differential Effects of Lowered Arousal on Covert and Overt Shifts of Attention.
26073766|a|UNASSIGNED: Based on previous studies demonstrating detrimental effects of reduced alertness on attentional orienting our study seeks to examine covert and overt attentional orienting in different arousal states. We hypothesized an attentional asymmetry with increasing reaction times to stimuli presented to the left visual field in a state of maximally reduced arousal. Eleven healthy participants underwent sleep deprivation and were examined repeatedly every 4 hr over 28 hr in total with two tasks measuring covert and overt orienting of attention. Contrary to our hypothesis, a reduction of arousal did not induce any asymmetry of overt orienting. Even in participants with profound and significant attentional asymmetries in covert orienting no substantial reaction time differences between left- and right-sided targets in the overt orienting task could be observed. This result is not in agreement with assumptions of a tight coupling of covert and overt attentional processes. In conclusion, we found differential effects of lowered arousal induced by sleep deprivation on covert and overt orienting of attention. This pattern of results points to a neuronal non-overlap of brain structures subserving these functions and a differential influence of the norepinephrine system on these modes of spatial attention.

26076016|t|Exploring Differentially Expressed Genes and Natural Antisense Transcripts in Sheep (Ovis aries) Skin with Different Wool Fiber Diameters by Digital Gene Expression Profiling.
26076016|a|UNASSIGNED: Wool fiber diameter (WFD) is the most important economic trait of wool. However, the genes specifically controlling WFD remain elusive. In this study, the expression profiles of skin from two groups of Gansu Alpine merino sheep with different WFD (a super-fine wool group [FD = 18.0    0.5  m, n= 3] and a fine wool group [FD=23.0  0.5 m, n=3]) were analyzed using next-generation sequencing-based digital gene expression profiling. A total of 40 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, including 9 up-regulated genes and 31 down-regulated genes. Further expression profile analysis of natural antisense transcripts (NATs) showed that more than 30% of the genes presented in sheep skin expression profiles had NATs. A total of 7 NATs with significant differential expression were detected, and all were down-regulated. Among of 40 DEGs, 3 DEGs (AQP8, Bos d2, and SPRR) had significant NATs which were all significantly down-regulated in the super-fine wool group. In total of DEGs and NATs were summarized as 3 main GO categories and 38 subcategories. Among the molecular functions, cellular components and biological processes categories, binding, cell part and metabolic process were the most dominant subcategories, respectively. However, no significant enrichment of GO terms was found (corrected P-value >0.05). The pathways that were significantly enriched with significant DEGs and NATs were mainly the lipoic acid metabolism, bile secretion, salivary secretion and ribosome and phenylalanine metabolism pathways (P < 0.05). The results indicated that expression of NATs and gene transcripts were correlated, suggesting a role in gene regulation. The discovery of these DEGs and NATs could facilitate enhanced selection for super-fine wool sheep through gene-assisted selection or targeted gene manipulation in the future.

26080319|t|Plasma protein biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease endophenotypes in asymptomatic older twins: early cognitive decline and regional brain volumes.
26080319|a|UNASSIGNED: There is great interest in blood-based markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially in its pre-symptomatic stages. Therefore, we aimed to identify plasma proteins whose levels associate with potential markers of pre-symptomatic AD. We also aimed to characterise confounding by genetics and the effect of genetics on blood proteins in general. Panel-based proteomics was performed using SOMAscan on plasma samples from TwinsUK subjects who are asymptomatic for AD, measuring the level of 1129 proteins. Protein levels were compared with 10-year change in CANTAB-paired associates learning (PAL; n=195), and regional brain volumes (n=34). Replication of proteins associated with regional brain volumes was performed in 254 individuals from the AddNeuroMed cohort. Across all the proteins measured, genetic factors were found to explain ~26% of the variability in blood protein levels on average. The plasma level of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) MAPKAPK5 protein was found to positively associate with the 10-year change in CANTAB-PAL in both the individual and twin difference context. The plasma level of protein MAP2K4 was found to suggestively associate negatively (Q<0.1) with the volume of the left entorhinal cortex. Future studies will be needed to assess the specificity of MAPKAPK5 and MAP2K4 to eventual conversion to AD.

26080199|t|Subcostal Skin Graft Donor Site for Autologous Ear Construction.
26080199|a|UNASSIGNED: Autologous ear construction for microtia creates an auricle using a costal cartilage framework. To separate the construct from the mastoid, a skin graft is required to form a retroauricular sulcus. Skin graft donor sites that have been described include the inguinal area (split or full-thickness) or scalp (split-thickness). The purpose of this study is to report a novel skin graft donor site for ear construction. We harvest a full-thickness graft from the subcostal area based on the previous scar from the cartilage harvest. Unlike the inguinal donor site, this method does not place an additional scar on the child. In contrast to the scalp donor site, the technique is simpler and a full-thickness graft minimizes contraction of the retroauricular sulcus.

26079466|t|Influence of Back Pain on Patient Satisfaction Scores.
26079466|a|OBJECTIVES: Patient satisfaction scores are increasing in importance. Although the influence of selected patient and physician characteristics on satisfaction scores has been identified, the impact of different pediatric diagnoses is unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare patient satisfaction scores in visits for mechanical back pain with visits for clubfoot or scoliosis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patient satisfaction scores from pediatric visits for back pain, clubfoot, and scoliosis at three tertiary centers was performed. Satisfaction data were obtained from survey questions that used a 5-point scale ranging from very poor (1) to very good (5). Statistical analysis was performed using   (2) and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: Data from 565 visits for scoliosis, 81 for clubfoot, and 57 for mechanical back pain were used. The mean scores in back pain visits for the likelihood of recommending the care provider, confidence in the care provider, and explanation by the care provider were 4.87, 4.79, and 4.70, respectively. These scores were not lower than visits for scoliosis and clubfoot (P < 0.05). The mean score for likelihood to recommend the practice after back pain visits was 4.73, with more scores of 3 or higher than clubfoot or scoliosis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Satisfaction scores in pediatric patients with back pain were not lower than visits for scoliosis or clubfoot. Future research can be directed toward identifying common goals in visits for pediatric mechanical back pain to further improve the patient experience.

26079492|t|Does Tyrosyl DNA Phosphodiesterase-2 Play a Role in Hepatitis B Virus Genome Repair?
26079492|a|UNASSIGNED: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and persistence are sustained by a nuclear episome, the covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA, which serves as the transcriptional template for all viral RNAs. CCC DNA is converted from a relaxed circular (RC) DNA in the virion early during infection as well as from RC DNA in intracellular progeny nucleocapsids via an intracellular amplification pathway. Current antiviral therapies suppress viral replication but cannot eliminate CCC DNA. Thus, persistence of CCC DNA remains an obstacle toward curing chronic HBV infection. Unfortunately, very little is known about how CCC DNA is formed. CCC DNA formation requires removal of the virally encoded reverse transcriptase (RT) protein from the 5' end of the minus strand of RC DNA. Tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase-2 (Tdp2) was recently identified as the enzyme responsible for cleavage of tyrosyl-5' DNA linkages formed between topoisomerase II and cellular DNA. Because the RT-DNA linkage is also a 5' DNA-phosphotyrosyl bond, it has been hypothesized that Tdp2 might be one of several elusive host factors required for CCC DNA formation. Therefore, we examined the role of Tdp2 in RC DNA deproteination and CCC DNA formation. We demonstrated Tdp2 can cleave the tyrosyl-minus strand DNA linkage using authentic HBV RC DNA isolated from nucleocapsids and using RT covalently linked to short minus strand DNA produced in vitro. On the other hand, our results showed that Tdp2 gene knockout did not block CCC DNA formation during HBV infection of permissive human hepatoma cells and did not prevent intracellular amplification of duck hepatitis B virus CCC DNA. These results indicate that although Tdp2 can remove the RT covalently linked to the 5' end of the HBV minus strand DNA in vitro, this protein might not be required for CCC DNA formation in vivo.

26046676|t|Technical note: Development of Hemipyrellia ligurriens (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) at constant temperatures: Applications in estimating postmortem interval.
26046676|a|UNASSIGNED: Blowflies (Calliphoridae) are recognized as a powerful tool for estimating the minimum postmortem interval (PMImin). The times for blowflies to develop from oviposition to eclosion is mainly controlled by temperature, which can differ between even closely related species. Hemipyrellia ligurriens (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) is a blowfly distributed throughout Asia and Australia. However, a systematic determination of the developmental times of H. ligurriens under constant temperature, necessary for estimating the PMImin, is lacking. Such an examination would broaden the forensic importance of the species. Thus, this study explored the growth curves of larval H. ligurriens at 7 constant temperatures (16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, and 34  C). Isomegalen and isomorphen diagrams were successfully constructed, depicting the time of larval length or developmental event, respectively, at different temperatures. A thermal summation model was also constructed via regression analysis, by estimating the developmental threshold temperature t and thermal summation constant K. The thermal summation model indicated that t at 8.3  C and K at 5747.5 degree-hours (  Ch) are required for complete development from oviposition to eclosion, and suggested an optimum temperature range of 16-28  C for the development of H. ligurriens. These data establish for the first time the temperature-dependent developmental time of H. ligurriens for forensic entomology application. The 3 developmental models are provided.

26040300|t|Unusual root development following surgical repositioning of horizontally developing central incisor.
26040300|a|UNASSIGNED: Dilaceration is one of the causes of maxillary central incisor eruption failure. If the dilacerated maxillary permanent central incisor is in a horizontal or vertical position and root formation is in early stages, surgical repositioning is frequently the treatment of choice. In this article, the case of a horizontally impacted and dilacerated maxillary central incisor is presented which was treated by surgical repositioning. The tooth developed an unusual form of the root with discontinuity at the middle third region with the coronal and apical parts growing separately. Radiographic and clinical monitoring of the case was regularly performed. The tooth completely erupted in 2  years after the repositioning and even after 6 years of surgery is currently successfully functional in the arch with the malformed root. This article highlights the ability of Hertwig's epithelial root sheath to withstand trauma and its ability to recover.

26039913|t|Trapping of Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate at the Air-Water Interface of Oscillating Bubbles.
26039913|a|UNASSIGNED: We report that at very low initial bulk concentrations, a couple of hundred times below the critical micellar concentration (CMC), anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) adsorbed at the air-water interface of a gas bubble cannot be removed, on the time scale of the experiment (hours), when the surrounding solution is gently replaced by pure water. Extremely sensitive interferometric measurements of the resonance frequency of the bubble-forced oscillations give precise access to the concentration of the surfactant monolayer. The bulk-interface dynamic exchange of SDS molecules is shown to be inhibited below a concentration which we believe refers to a kind of gas-liquid phase transition of the surface monolayer. Above this threshold we recover the expected concentration-dependent desorption. The experimental observations are interpreted within simple energetic considerations supported by molecular dynamics (MD) calculations.

26049810|t|Nurses' perceptions of using an evidence-based care bundle for initial emergency nursing management of patients with severe traumatic brain injury: A qualitative study.
26049810|a|UNASSIGNED: Evidence to guide initial emergency nursing care of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Thailand is currently not available in a useable form. A care bundle was used to summarise an evidence-based approach to the initial emergency nursing management of patients with severe TBI and was implemented in one Thai emergency department. The aim of this study was to describe Thai emergency nurses' perceptions of care bundle use. A descriptive qualitative study was used to describe emergency nurses' perceptions of care bundle use during the implementation phase (Phase-One) and then post-implementation (Phase-Two). Ten emergency nurses participated in Phase-One, while 12 nurses participated in Phase-Two. In Phase-One, there were five important factors identified in relation to use of the care bundle including quality of care, competing priorities, inadequate equipment, agitated patients, and teamwork. In Phase Two, participants perceived that using the care bundle helped them to improve quality of care, increased nurses' knowledge, skills, and confidence. Care bundles are one strategy to increase integration of research evidence into clinical practice and facilitate healthcare providers to deliver optimal patient care in busy environments with limited resources.

26044390|t|Molecular Diversity of Compounds from Pygidial Gland Secretions of Cave-Dwelling Ground Beetles: The First Evidence.
26044390|a|UNASSIGNED: Three adult cave-dwelling ground beetle species were induced to discharge secretions of their pygidial glands into vials. Dichloromethane extraction was used to obtain the secretions. In total, 42 compounds were identified by GC/MS analysis. Pheggomisetes ninae contained 32 glandular compounds, Laemostenus (Pristonychus) punctatus 13, whereas Duvalius (Paraduvalius) milutini had nine compounds. Caproic, oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids were present in the samples of all analyzed species. Undecane was predominant in the extract of L. punctatus. Palmitic acid was the major component in the secretion of D. milutini. Finally, the most abundant compounds in P. ninae secretion were heptacosene and nonacosadienes. Herein, we present the first data on the identification of pygidial gland secretion components in both troglophilous and troglobite cave-dwelling ground beetles. Some compounds are reported for the first time in the secretions of ground beetles and other higher or lower taxa. The adaptation to underground life has not led to a reduction or changes in the chemical defense mechanism in the analyzed troglophilous and troglobitic Platyninae and Trechinae taxa.

26001227|t|Evolving Early Lung Cancers Detected During Follow-Up of Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonia: Serial CT Features.
26001227|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the CT characteristics of newly developed lung cancer on CT studies obtained during follow-up of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) before the appearance of identifiable tumors to the time of detectable lung cancer and thereafter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sample included 66 cancers diagnosed in 63 patients with IIP and lung cancer (59 men, four women; median age, 64 years; range, 40-85 years) between October 1998 and July 2012. Two radiologists independently reviewed 193 CT scans, determined the earliest presence of cancer and IIP, and evaluated tumor size, lobar and axial location, shape, and tumor density. Delay in clinical diagnosis and doubling time were measured with first and second follow-up CT examinations. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was good (k > 0.77). The median tumor size was 17 mm (range, 5-30 mm) for the 46 T1a and 20 T1b cancers. Most of the tumors (42 [63.6%]) were located in the lower lobes. Thirty-five tumors (53.0%) were at the interface between fibrotic cyst and normal lung, and 21 (31.8%) were in the midst of fibrotic lung cysts. Most of the tumors had a round or oval shape (52 [78.8%]) and were solid (62 [93.9%]). The median delay in diagnosis was 46 days (range, 8-760 days). The first median doubling time was 77 days (range, 15-525 days), and the second was 53 days (27-248). CONCLUSION: New lung cancers during CT follow-up of IIP usually appear as small solid nodules with a round or oval shape. Most cancers are located at the interface between fibrotic cyst and normal lung or in the midst of fibrotic cysts of the lower lobes of subpleural lung.

26024650|t|The High performance of nanocrystalline CVD diamond coated hip joints in wear simulator test.
26024650|a|UNASSIGNED: The superior biotribological performance of nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) coatings grown by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method was already shown to demonstrate high wear resistance in ball on plate experiments under physiological liquid lubrication. However, tests with a close-to-real approach were missing and this constitutes the aim of the present work. Hip joint wear simulator tests were performed with cups and heads made of silicon nitride coated with NCD of ~10 m in thickness. Five million testing cycles (Mc) were run, which represent nearly five years of hip joint implant activity in a patient. For the wear analysis, gravimetry, profilometry, scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy techniques were used. After 0.5 Mc of wear test, truncation of the protruded regions of the NCD film happened as a result of a fine-scale abrasive wear mechanism, evolving to extensive plateau regions and highly polished surface condition (Ra<10nm). Such surface modification took place without any catastrophic features as cracking, grain pullouts or delamination of the coatings. A steady state volumetric wear rate of 0.02mm(3)/Mc, equivalent to a linear wear of 0.27 m/Mc favorably compares with the best performance reported in the literature for the fourth generation alumina ceramic (0.05mm(3)/Mc). Also, squeaking, quite common phenomenon in hard-on-hard systems, was absent in the present all-NCD system.

26071840|t|Botryane, noreudesmane and abietane terpenoids from the ascomycete Hypoxylon rickii.
26071840|a|UNASSIGNED: In the course of our screening for new bioactive natural products, a culture of Hypoxylon rickii, a xylariaceous ascomycete collected from the Caribbean island Martinique, was identified as extraordinary prolific producer of secondary metabolites. Ten metabolites of terpenoid origin were isolated from submerged cultures of this species by preparative HPLC. Their structures were elucidated using spectral techniques including 2D NMR and HRESIMS. Three of the compounds were elucidated as new botryanes (1-3) along with three known ones, i.e. (3aS)-3a,5,5,8-tetramethyl-3,3a,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[de]isochromen-1-one (4), (3aS,8R)-3a,5,5,8-tetramethyl-3,3a,4,5,7,8-hexahydro-1H-cyclopenta[de]isochromen-1-one (5) and botryenanol (6). Further three new sesquiterpenoids featured a 14-noreudesmane-type skeleton and were named hypoxylan A-C (7-9); the diterpenoid rickitin A (10) contains an abietane-type backbone. Compounds 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10 showed cytotoxic effects against murine cells.

26018157|t|Human blood circulating basophils capture HIV-1 and mediate viral trans-infection of CD4+ T cells.
26018157|a|UNASSIGNED: Cell-associated HIV-1 infection has been proposed to play a pivotal role in the spread of HIV-1 infection. Granulocytes are a category of white blood cells, comprising mainly basophils, neutrophils and eosinophils, and participate in various inflammatory reactions and defense against pathogens. Here, we investigated the role of human blood granulocytes in the dissemination of HIV-1. These cells were found to express a variety of HIV-1 attachment factors (HAFs). Basophils expressed HAFs DC-SIGN, DCIR, HSPG and a4b7 integrin, and mediated the most efficient capture of HIV-1 on the cell surface. Neutrophils were found to express DCIR, and demonstrated limited efficiency of viral capture. Eosinophils expressed a4b7 integrin, but exhibited little or no virus-binding capacity. . Intriguingly, following direct contact with CD4(+) T cells, viruses harbored on the surface of basophils-were transferred to T cells. The contact between basophils and CD4(+) T cells and formation of infectious synapses appeared necessary for efficient HIV-1 spread. In HIV-1 infected individuals, the frequency of basophils remained fairly stable over the course of disease, regardless of CD4(+) T depletion or the emergence of AIDS-associated opportunistic infections. . Collectively, our results provide novel insights into the roles of granulocytes, particularly basophils, in HIV-1 dissemination. Thus, strategies designed to prevent basophil-mediated viral capture and transfer may be developed into a new form of therapy. IMPORTANCE: Cell-associated HIV-1 infection has been proposed to play a pivotal role in the spread of HIV-1 infection. Here, we demonstrate that human blood circulating granulocytes, particularly basophils, can capture HIV-1 and mediate viral trans-infection of CD4(+) T cells. The expression of a variety of HIV-1 attachment factors, such as the C-type lectins, etc., facilitates viral capture and transfer. Intriguingly, the frequency of basophils remains fairly stable during the course of disease, in patients with different levels of CD4(+) T count. Our results provide novel insights into the roles of granulocytes, particularly basophils, in HIV-1 dissemination. We suggest that strategies designed to prevent basophils-mediated viral capture and transfer may be a new direction for the development of anti-HIV therapy.

26017481|t|A Model to Predict the Feasibility of Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy With Temozolomide in Glioblastoma Multiforme Patients Over Age 65.
26017481|a|OBJECTIVES: It is controversial whether concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with temozolomide is feasible and beneficial in elderly patients with glioblastoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 74 elderly glioblastoma patients (65 y and above) treated with concurrent CRT with temozolomide. Factors influencing prognosis and feasibility of CRT were investigated. RESULTS: The median overall survival was 11.3 months. Univariate analysis showed a significant difference in median overall survival for cumulative dose of concurrent temozolomide (optimal cutoff, 2655 mg/m; 13.9 mo for >2655 mg/m vs. 4.9 mo for  <=2655 mg/m; P=0.0216, adjusted for multiple testing). Furthermore, cumulative dose of concurrent temozolomide >2655 mg/m was a significant independent prognostic parameter in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 0.33; P=0.002). Hematotoxicity was the most common cause of treatment interruption or discontinuation in patients with an insufficient cumulative temozolomide dose. Prognostic factors for successful performance of CRT with a cumulative dose of concurrent temozolomide >2655 mg/m were female sex (odds ratio [OR], 0.174; P=0.006), age (OR, 0.826 per year; P=0.017), and pretreatment platelet count (OR, 1.013 per 1000 platelets/  L; P=0.001). For easy clinical application of the model an online calculator was developed, which is available at http://www.OldTMZ.com. CONCLUSIONS: The probability of successful performance of concurrent CRT with temozolomide can be estimated based on the patient's age, sex, and pretreatment platelet count using the model developed in this study. Thus, a subgroup of elderly glioblastoma patients suitable for chemoradiation with temozolomide can be identified.

26016945|t|Heart rate recovery and parasympathetic modulation in boys and girls following maximal and submaximal exercise.
26016945|a|PURPOSE: This study examined heart rate recovery (HRR) and heart rate variability (HRV) following submaximal and maximal exercise in boys (n  =  13; 10.1      0.8 years) and girls (n  =  12; 10.1      0.7 years). METHODS: Participants completed 10  min of supine rest followed by a graded exercise test to maximal effort. On a separate day, participants performed submaximal exercise at ventilatory threshold. Immediately following both exercise bouts, 1-min HRR was assessed in the supine position. HRV variables were analyzed under controlled breathing in the time and frequency domains over the final 5  min of rest and recovery. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in HRR following maximal and submaximal exercise between boys (58      8 and 59      8 beats  min(-1), respectively) and girls (54      6 and 52      19 beats  min(-1), respectively). There also were no significant interactions between groups from rest to recovery from maximal exercise for any HRV variables. However, there was a difference in the response between sexes from rest to recovery from submaximal exercise for log transformed standard deviation of NN intervals (lnSDNN) and log transformed total power (lnTP). No differences were observed for lnSDNN at rest (boys  =  4.61      0.28 vs. girls  =  4.28      0.52  ms) or during recovery (lnSDNN: boys 3.78      0.46 vs. girls 3.87      0.64  ms and lnTP: boys 7.33      1.09 vs. girls; 7.44      1.24  ms(2)). Post hoc pairwise comparisons showed a significant difference between boys and girls for lnTP at rest (boys  =  9.14      0.42 vs. girls  =  8.30      1.05  ms(2)). CONCLUSION: Parasympathetic modulation was similar between boys and girls at rest and during recovery from exercise, which could explain similarities observed in HRR.

26020141|t|Immunotherapeutic Applications of NK Cells.
26020141|a|UNASSIGNED: Natural Killer (NK) cells are lymphoid cells that exhibit an innate response against virus-infected cells. These cells are also capable of mounting an immune response against tumor cells after education through major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. NK cell regulation is mediated through IFN-gamma and IL-15, important cytokines which can drive NK cell expansion in vivo. Previous studies have shown effective infusion of allogeneic NK cells after lymphodepleting regimens with induction of remission of poor prognosis acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Challenges remain in the expansion of these NK cells once infused and in their education to recognize tumor targets. A principal mechanism of tumor recognition is through KIR mismatch in cells lacking self MHC I molecules. Activating KIRs exist, though their ligands are unknown at this time. Impacting NK cell expansion and education in vivo has been challenging, and thus far clinical applications of NK cells have shown promise in helping to maintain remission in humans, though this remission has not been maintained. Future efforts to utilize NK cells clinically are focusing on developing more consistency in successful expansion of NK cell and educating them to recognize their tumor targets. Additional efforts to utilize novel antibody-based therapy to engage NK cells to their tumor targets are also in development.

26000482|t|Regnase-1 and Roquin Regulate a Common Element in Inflammatory mRNAs by Spatiotemporally Distinct Mechanisms.
26000482|a|UNASSIGNED: Regnase-1 and Roquin are RNA binding proteins essential for degradation of inflammation-related mRNAs and maintenance of immune homeostasis. However, their mechanistic relationship has yet to be clarified. Here, we show that, although Regnase-1 and Roquin regulate an overlapping set of mRNAs via  a common stem-loop structure, they function in  distinct subcellular locations: ribosome/endoplasmic reticulum and processing-body/stress granules, respectively. Moreover, Regnase-1 specifically cleaves and degrades translationally active mRNAs and requires the helicase activity of UPF1, similar to the decay mechanisms of nonsense mRNAs. In contrast, Roquin controls translationally inactive mRNAs, independent of UPF1. Defects in both Regnase-1 and Roquin lead to large increases in their target mRNAs, although Regnase-1 tends to control the early phase of inflammation when mRNAs are more actively translated. Our findings reveal that differential regulation of mRNAs by Regnase-1 and Roquin depends on their translation status and enables elaborate control of inflammation.

26034163|t|The New Hampshire Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding Collaborative: A Statewide QI Initiative.
26034163|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite national recognition for their breastfeeding-friendly practices, many New Hampshire hospitals are still not achieving the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. To increase achievement of the Ten Steps in New Hampshire's birthing hospitals, facilitate Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) designation for interested hospitals, and improve rates of in-hospital any and exclusive breastfeeding. METHODS: After a 2010 needs assessment, we conducted 2 statewide workshops targeting 6 of the Ten Steps found to be most deficient among New Hampshire birthing hospitals. Eighteen of 20 hospitals attended at least 1 workshop, and 6 participated in an intensive collaborative. In 2013, we analyzed interval Ten Step achievement and in-hospital breastfeeding trends. RESULTS: Staff education showed the greatest improvement, increasing step 2 achievement from 1 to 6 hospitals (P = .05). Although the number of hospitals implementing step 6 (breast milk only) and step 9 (no artificial nipples) increased, differences were not statistically significant. Intensive collaborative hospitals achieved an average of 1.5 new steps, whereas non-Baby Friendly hospitals lost 0.7 steps (P = .05). In-hospital breastfeeding rates increased in intensive collaborative hospitals and were significantly higher than those in non-Baby Friendly hospitals by the end of the study (any breastfeeding, 89% vs 73%, P = .03; exclusive breastfeeding, 84% vs 61%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: A statewide improvement collaborative facilitated increases in Ten Step achievement and in-hospital breastfeeding for hospitals participating in an intensive collaborative. Active work in Ten Step implementation, including staff education, appears to be more effective in increasing in-hospital breastfeeding than does BFHI designation alone.

26062877|t|Cells of renin lineage are adult pluri-potent progenitors in experimental glomerular disease.
26062877|a|UNASSIGNED: Modified vascular smooth muscle cells of the kidney afferent arterioles have recently been shown to serve as progenitors for glomerular epithelial cells in response to glomerular injury. To determine if such cells of renin lineage (CoRL) serve as progenitors for other cells in kidney disease characterized by both glomerular and tubulo-interstitial injury, permanent genetic cell-fate mapping of adult CoRL using Ren1cCreER x Rs-tdTomato-R reporter mice was performed. TdTomato-labeled CoRL were almost completely restricted to the juxta-glomerular compartment in healthy kidneys. Following two weeks of antibody-mediated FSGS or 16 weeks of 5/6 nephrectomy-induced chronic kidney diseases, tdTomato-mapped CoRL were identified in both interstitial and glomerular compartments. In the interstitium, PDGF  -R expressing cells significantly increased, and a portion of these expressed tdTomato. This was accompanied by a decrease in native pericyte number, but an increase in the number of tdTomato cells that co-expressed the pericyte markers PDGF  -R and NG2. These cells surrounded vessels and co-expressed the pericyte markers CD73 and CD146, but not the endothelial marker ERG. Within glomeruli of reporter mice with the 5/6 nephrectomy model, a subset of labeled CoRL migrated to the glomerular tuft and co-expressed podocin and synaptopodin. By contrast, labeled CoRL were not detected in glomerular or interstitial compartments following uninephrectomy. These observations indicate that in addition to supplying new podocytes to glomeruli, CoRL have the capacity to become new adult pericytes in the setting of interstitial disease. We conclude that CoRL have the potential to function as progenitors for multiple cell types in kidney disease.

26115601|t|contributions of attention and elaboration to associative encoding in young and older adults.
26115601|a|UNASSIGNED: Episodic memory declines during healthy aging, with a particular reduction in the ability to encode associations. We investigated the role of alternating attentional focus between two items of a pair in order to generate associative links, as well as working memory based elaborative processes in this age-related memory deficit. While their eye gaze behavior and ERPs were recorded, 19 young and 22 elderly (64-79 years) participants used interactive imagery to encode pairs of spatially separated objects. In a subsequent recognition test, older adults showed a larger reduction in associative- than item memory, relative to young adults. For both age groups the number of eye gaze transitions between objects at encoding was correlated with associative recognition performance, suggesting that alternating attentional focus between items aids the generation of relational links necessary to encode associative memories. However, the relative time course of eye gaze transitions over the encoding interval for trials that were subsequently retrieved vs. forgotten differed between age groups. Furthermore, the ERPs of older adults exhibited strongly reduced frontal slow wave "subsequent memory effects", suggesting that they engaged to a lesser extent in working memory-based elaboration of the associative link. Based on these results, we propose that older adults exhibit a reduced tendency to generate and elaborate on internal representations of inter-item associative links. Rather, they use a less effective encoding strategy that disproportionally relies on the external stimulus display, resulting in lower associative memory performance.

26117275|t|Vasoconstrictor clysis in burn surgery and its impact on outcomes: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
26117275|a|AIM: Clysis is the subcutaneous or subdermal injection of a vasopressor containing fluid, with or without local anaesthetic agent, and has been used to limit blood loss in patients undergoing surgical burn management. In this systematic review and meta-analysis we aimed to determine the impact of clysis of a vasoconstrictor on burn patient outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to identify trials investigating clysis in burn patients undergoing debridement and/or skin grafting. For each eligible trial we aimed to extract the outcomes of perioperative blood loss, blood transfusion, duration of surgery, graft success and healing time, inflammatory response, sepsis, mortality, duration of hospital stay, catecholamine levels and cardiovascular effects in both the short (<72h) and long term (30 days) after surgery. RESULTS: From 443 citations, we selected 39 for full-text evaluation, and identified 10 eligible trials. Due to a lack of reporting on outcomes of interest, meta-analysis could only be conducted for the outcome of red blood cell (RBC) units transfused per patient. Patients receiving clysis (n=222) were transfused 1.89 less units (95% CI -2.12 to -1.66) as compared to those not receiving clysis, although this was associated with a high degree of heterogeneity (I(2)=88%). CONCLUSION: Few studies have adequately evaluated the impact of clysis in burn surgery on patient important outcomes such mortality, duration of surgery and graft success. These results suggest clysis may reduce the need for blood transfusion but additional high quality research is required.

26112977|t|Phosphoproteins with Stability against All Urinary Phosphatases as Potential Biomarkers in Urine.
26112977|a|UNASSIGNED: Urine, by accumulating all kinds of changes, was proposed to be a better source for biomarker discovery. As one of the most common post-translational modifications, phosphorylation plays a vital role in many biological activities. However, the urine phosphoproteome has been largely neglected due to the low abundance of phosphoproteins and the presence of various phosphatases in urine. The low level of background phosphorylation in urine is actually advantageous, as urinary phosphopeptides/proteins that are stable to the phosphatases present in urine have the potential to serve as valuable disease biomarkers. Using a TiO2 enrichment strategy, this study aimed to create a comprehensive proteomic profile of human urinary phosphoproteins and to characterize the changes in the urine phosphoproteome after incubation of urine with renal carcinoma cell lysates. In total, 106 urine phosphorylation sites corresponding to 64 proteins, including 80 previously unidentified human urine protein phosphorylation sites, were identified by mass spectrometry. Fifteen phosphopeptides, together averaging 47% of the total phosphopeptides, were found in samples from three individuals. Cellular proteins are potential source of biomarker in urine phosphorylated proteins. Addition of renal carcinoma cellular proteins to urine did not significantly change the phosphorylation level of urine proteins. But there were still a few phosphopeptides from cell lysates survived urinary phosphatases; such phosphopeptides represent potential biomarkers in urine.

26114672|t|Ground-based inhibition: Suppressive perceptual mechanisms interact with top-down attention to reduce distractor interference.
26114672|a|UNASSIGNED: Successful attentional function requires inhibition of distracting information (e.g., Deutsch _ Deutsch, 1963). Similarly, perceptual segregation of the visual world into figure and ground entails ground suppression (e.g., Likova _ Tyler, 2008; Peterson _ Skow, 2008). Here, we ask whether the suppressive processes of attention and perception-distractor inhibition and ground suppression-interact to more effectively insulate task performance from interfering information. We used a variant of the Eriksen flanker paradigm to assess the efficacy of distractor inhibition. Participants indicated the right/left orientation of a central arrow, which could be flanked by congruent, neutral, or incongruent stimuli. We manipulated the degree to which the ground region of a display was suppressed and measured the influence of this manipulation on the efficacy with which participants could inhibit responses from incongruent flankers. Greater ground suppression reduced the influence on target identification of interfering, incongruent information, but not that of facilitative, congruent information. These data are the first to show that distractor inhibition interacts with ground suppression to improve attentional function.

26113224|t|Grey scale texture analysis of endobronchial ultrasound mini probe images for prediction of benign or malignant aetiology.
26113224|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Expert analysis of endobronchial ultrasound mini probe (EBUS-MP) images has established subjective criteria for discriminating benign and malignant disease. Minimal data are available for objective analysis of these images. The aim of this study was to determine if greyscale texture analysis could differentiate between benign and malignant lung lesions. METHODS: Digital EBUS-MP images with a gain setting of 10/19 and contrast setting of 4/8 from 2007 until 2012 inclusive were included. These images had an expert-defined region of interest (ROI) mapped. ROI were analysed for the following greyscale texture features: mean pixel value, difference between maximum and minimum pixel value, standard deviation of the mean pixel value, entropy, correlation, energy and homogeneity. Significant greyscale texture features differentiating benign from malignant disease were used by two physicians to assess a validation set. RESULTS: A total of 167 images were available. The first 85 lesions were used in the prediction set. Benign lesions had larger differences between maximum and minimum pixel values, larger standard deviations of the mean pixel values and higher entropy than malignant lesions (P   <   0.0001 for all values). A total of 82 peripheral lesions were in the validation set. Physician 1 correctly classified 63/82 (76.8%) with a negative predictive value (NPV) for malignancy of 82% and positive predictive value (PPV) of 75%. Physician 2 correctly classified 62/82 (75.6%) with a NPV of 100% and PPV of 71.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Greyscale texture analysis of EBUS-MP images can help establish aetiology with a high NPV for malignancy.

26113162|t|An Early Warning Scoring System to Identify Septic Patients in the Prehospital Setting: The PRESEP Score.
26113162|a|OBJECTIVES: The objective was to develop and evaluate an early sepsis detection score for the prehospital setting. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who were admitted by emergency medical services (EMS) to the emergency department of the Jena University Hospital was performed. Because potential predictors for sepsis should be based on consensus criteria, the following parameters were extracted from the EMS protocol for further analysis: temperature, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (SaO2 ), Glasgow Coma Scale score, blood glucose, and systolic blood pressure (sBP). Potential predictors were stratified based on inspection of Loess graphs. Backward model selection was performed to select risk factors for the final model. The Prehospital Early Sepsis Detection (PRESEP) score was calculated as the sum of simplified regression weights. Its predictive validity was compared to the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), the Robson screening tool, and the BAS 90-30-90. RESULTS: A total of 375 patients were included in the derivation sample; 93 (24.8%) of these had sepsis, including 60 patients with severe sepsis and 12 patients with septic shock. Backward model selection identified temperature, HR, RR, SaO2 , and sBP for inclusion in the PRESEP score. Simplified weights were as follows: temperature > 38  C  =  4, temperature < 36  C  =  1, HR > 90 beats/min  =  2, RR > 22 breaths/min  =  1, SaO2 < 92%  =  2, and sBP < 90  mm Hg  =  2. The cutoff value for a possible existing septic disease based on maximum Youden's index was >= 4 (sensitivity 0.85, specificity 0.86, positive predictive value [PPV] 0.66, and negative predictive value [NPV] 0.95). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the PRESEP score was 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]  =  0.89 to 0.96) and was larger than the AUC of the MEWS (0.93 vs. 0.77, p < 0.001). The PRESEP score surpassed MEWS and BAS 90-60-90 for sensitivity (0.74 and 0.62, respectively), specificity (0.75 and 0.83), PPV (0.45 and 0.51), and NPV (0.91 and 0.89). The Robson screening tool had a higher sensitivity and NPV (0.95 and 0.97), but its specificity and PPV were lower (0.43 and 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: The PRESEP score could be a valuable tool for identifying septic patients in the prehospital setting in the case of suspected infection. It should be prospectively validated.

26111531|t|Analysis of physiological responses associated with emotional changes induced by viewing video images of dental treatments.
26111531|a|Since the understanding of emotional changes induced by dental treatments is important for dentists to provide a safe and comfortable dental treatment, we analyzed physiological responses during watching video images of dental treatments to search for the appropriate objective indices reflecting emotional changes. Fifteen healthy young adult subjects voluntarily participated in the present study. Electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and corrugator muscle electromyogram (EMG) were recorded and changes of them by viewing videos of dental treatments were analyzed. The subjective discomfort level was acquired by Visual Analog Scale method. Analyses of autonomic nervous activities from ECG and four emotional factors (anger/stress, joy/satisfaction, sadness/depression and relaxation) from EEG demonstrated that increases in sympathetic nervous activity reflecting stress increase and decreases in relaxation level were induced by the videos of infiltration anesthesia and cavity excavation, but not intraoral examination. The corrugator muscle activity was increased by all three images regardless of video contents. The subjective discomfort during watching infiltration anesthesia and cavity excavation was higher than intraoral examination, showing that sympathetic activities and relaxation factor of emotion changed in a manner consistent with subjective emotional changes. These results suggest that measurement of autonomic nervous activities estimated from ECG and emotional factors analyzed from EEG is useful for objective evaluation of subjective emotion.

26114960|t|Silencing of DNase Colicin E8 Gene Expression by a Complex Nucleoprotein Assembly Ensures Timely Colicin Induction.
26114960|a|UNASSIGNED: Colicins are plasmid-encoded narrow spectrum antibiotics that are synthesized by strains of Escherichia coli and govern intraspecies competition. In a previous report, we demonstrated that the global transcriptional factor IscR, co dependently with the master regulator of the DNA damage response, LexA, delays induction of the pore forming colicin genes after SOS induction. Here we show that IscR is not involved in the regulation of nuclease colicins, but that the AsnC protein is. We report that AsnC, in concert with LexA, is the key controller of the temporal induction of the DNA degrading colicin E8 gene (cea8), after DNA damage. We demonstrate that a large AsnC nucleosome-like structure, in conjunction with two LexA molecules, prevent cea8 transcription initiation and that AsnC binding activity is directly modulated by L asparagine. We show that L-asparagine is an environmental factor that has a marked impact on cea8 promoter regulation. Our results show that AsnC also modulates the expression of several other DNase and RNase colicin genes but does not substantially affect pore-forming colicin K gene expression. We propose that selection pressure has "chosen" highly conserved regulators to control colicin expression in E. coli strains, enabling similar colicin gene silencing among bacteria upon exchange of colicinogenic plasmids.

26115041|t|SNP rs2057482 in HIF1A gene predicts clinical outcome of aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma patients after surgery.
26115041|a|UNASSIGNED: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a) plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis. Genetic variations of HIF1A gene have been shown to influence the developing risk and prognosis in many types of human malignancies. However, their association with clinical outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients remains unclear. To investigate the predictive role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HIF1A gene in HCC patients' outcomes, we genotyped three functional SNPs (rs2057482, rs1957757 and rs2301113) in HIF1A gene and assessed their associations with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of 492 surgical HCC patients. The patients with variant alleles (CT+TT) of SNP rs2057482 had a significantly lower recurrence risk when compared with patients with the CC genotype. In stratified analysis, the protective effect of rs2057482 CT+TT genotype was more evident in patients with adverse strata, compared with patients with favorable strata. Additionally, strong joint predictive effect between rs2057482 genotypes and AFP level, stage or differentiation were observed. Functional assay also indicated the significant effect of rs2057482 on gene expression. In conclusion, SNP rs2057482 in HIF1A gene is significantly associated with clinical outcomes of Chinese HCC patients after surgery, especially in those with aggressive status, which warrants further validation in other patient populations.

26060465|t|The phenomenon of diminishing -returns in the use of bed nets and indoor house spraying and the emerging place of antimalarial medicines in the control of malaria in Uganda.
26060465|a|BACKGROUND: The mosquito net existed long before it was known that mosquitoes transmitted malaria. Therefore it was not intended for malaria control. OBJECTIVES: To scrutinise the patterns of prevalence and identify any hitherto unknown factors that could explain the findings. METHODS: Retrieval of records on malaria prevalence. FINDINGS: Households sprayed in the previous 12 months or owning at least one ITN: 77.8% and IRS: 31.6% in mid-northern districts. Paradoxically, this was the highest malaria prevalence at 80.1%, hence the phenomenon of diminishing-returns. The urban children (28.6%), those of post-secondary education mothers (14.3%) and in the highest wealth quintile (33.3%) had a lower malaria prevalence than those without education (55.8%) and the less wealthy (67.6%), (p < 0.001). In all, the connection was that the urban (77.4%) and the wealthy (63.8%) sought health care first from hospitals, for proper treatment. Hence the low prevalence is most likely to be due to anti-malarial medicines and not to bed-nets and IRS, since the other findings of the survey show that there are no significant differences in bed nets ownership and usage and IRS in both groups. RECOMMENDATION: Antimalarial medicines should therefore be used to control malaria instead of the nets and IRS.

26066500|t|Collagen Cross-Linking for Late-onset Bleb Leakage: 1-Year Results.
26066500|a|PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of collagen cross-linking in the treatment of late-onset bleb leakage. METHODS: A retrospective, interventional case-series. Cross-linking was performed for late-onset bleb leakage after failure of standard medical therapy. Primary outcome is measured by complete resolution of bleb leakage. Secondary outcomes including intraocular pressure and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were documented over 1 year and were analyzed using repeated measure ANOVA. RESULTS: Seven patients underwent cross-linking for bleb leakage between 2012 and 2013. Five (71%) had complete resolution of bleb leakage. Intraocular pressure improved from 3.9  1.0 to 7.4  1.1 mm Hg at 1 to 2 months (P=0.0003) and remained at 9.6  3.0 mm Hg at final visit (P=0.06). The corresponding CDVA also improved from 0.6  0.2 to 0.38  0.37 logMAR (P=0.0069) at 1 to 2 months before stabilizing at 0.38  0.44 (P=0.0021) at 1 year. Two cases (29%) had persistent bleb leakage after treatment. Four patients (57%) had resolved hypotony (>= 6 mm Hg) at final visit. No adverse event was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Collagen cross-linking is a noninvasive treatment offering reasonable success rate for filtering bleb leakage, and may spare patients invasive surgical bleb revisions.

26066871|t|[Consensus of Verticality and Horizontality on the Monitor in Three-ports Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery].
26066871|a|Video-assisted thoracic surgery( VATS) has been utilized worldwide for treatment of thoracic disease in recent years. Then, in most VATS, the thoracoscope was handled by young surgeons consequently. In VATS, a role of the scopist is very important, because if there is no consensus of verticality and horizontality on the monitor among operator, assistant and scopist, it is difficult to perform the surgery smoothly. Therefore, it is important for young surgeons to improve their skills as scopist. However, there are few models of verticality and horizontality on the monitor and thoracoscope techniques of VATS. We present our consensus of verticality and horizontality on the monitor in the standard 3-ports VATS by right upper lobectomy and left upper lobectomy.

26066363|t|Recent advances in elementary flux modes and yield space analysis as useful tools in metabolic network studies.
26066363|a|UNASSIGNED: A review of the use of elementary flux modes (EFMs) and their applications in metabolic engineering covered with yield space analysis (YSA) is presented. EFMs are an invaluable tool in mathematical modeling of biochemical processes. They are described from their inception in 1994, followed by various improvements of their computation in later years. YSA constitutes another precious tool for metabolic network modeling, and is presented in details along with EFMs in this article. The application of these techniques is discussed for several case studies of metabolic network modeling provided in respective original articles. The article is concluded by some case studies in which the application of EFMs and YSA turned out to be most useful, such as the analysis of intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) formation and consumption in Cupriavidus necator, including the constraint-based description of the steady-state flux cone of the strain's metabolic network, the profound analysis of a continuous five-stage bioreactor cascade for PHA production by C. necator using EFMs and, finally, the study of metabolic fluxes in the metabolic network of C. necator cultivated on glycerol.

26099475|t|Errors in imaging of traumatic injuries.
26099475|a|UNASSIGNED: The advent of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) has drastically improved the outcomes of patients with multiple traumatic injuries. However, there are still diagnostic challenges to be considered. A missed or the delay of a diagnosis in trauma patients can sometimes be related to perception or other non-visual cues, while other errors are due to poor technique or poor image quality. In order to avoid any serious complications, it is important for the practicing radiologist to be cognizant of some of the most common types of errors. The objective of this article is to review the various types of errors in the evaluation of patients with multiple trauma injuries or polytrauma with MDCT.

26100010|t|Computational analysis of antigenic epitopes of avian influenza A (H7N9) viruses.
26100010|a|UNASSIGNED: Influenza virus can rapidly change its antigenicity, via mutation in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, to evade host immunity. The emergence of the novel human-infecting avian H7N9 virus in China has caused widespread concern. However, evolution of the antigenicity of this virus is not well understood. Here, we inferred the antigenic epitopes of the HA protein from all H7 viruses, based on the five well-characterized HA epitopes of the human H3N2 virus. By comparing the two major H7 phylogenetic lineages, i.e., the Eurasian lineage and the North American lineage, we found that epitopes A and B are more frequently mutated in the Eurasian lineage, while epitopes B and C are more frequently mutated in the North American lineage. Furthermore, we found that the novel H7N9 virus (derived from the Eurasian lineage) isolated in China in the year 2013, contains six frequently mutated sites on epitopes that include site 135, which is located in the receptor binding domain. This indicates that the novel H7N9 virus that infects human may already have been subjected to gradual immune pressure and receptor-binding variation. Our results not only provide insights into the antigenic evolution of the H7 virus but may also help in the selection of suitable vaccine strains.

26098132|t|DNA Yield From Tissue Samples in Surgical Pathology and Minimum Tissue Requirements for Molecular Testing.
26098132|a|UNASSIGNED: Context .- Complex molecular assays are increasingly used to direct therapy and provide diagnostic and prognostic information but can require relatively large amounts of DNA. Objectives .- To provide data to pathologists to help them assess tissue adequacy and provide prospective guidance on the amount of tissue that should be procured. Design .- We used slide-based measurements to establish a relationship between processed tissue volume and DNA yield by A260 from 366 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples submitted for the 3 most common molecular assays performed in our laboratory (EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF). We determined the average DNA yield per unit of tissue volume, and we used the distribution of DNA yields to calculate the minimum volume of tissue that should yield sufficient DNA 99% of the time. Results .- All samples with a volume greater than 8 mm(3) yielded at least 1  g of DNA, and more than 80% of samples producing less than 1  g were extracted from less than 4 mm(3) of tissue. Nine square millimeters of tissue should produce more than 1  g of DNA 99% of the time. Conclusions .- We conclude that 2 tissue cores, each 1 cm long and obtained with an 18-gauge needle, will almost always provide enough DNA for complex multigene assays, and our methodology may be readily extrapolated to individual institutional practice.

26084677|t|Associations between psychotic symptoms and substance use in young offenders.
26084677|a|INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Substance use and psychotic symptoms/disorders are associated. There has been little examination of this issue in young offenders, despite elevated substance use in this group. DESIGN AND METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted by trained researchers with 514 young offenders. Psychotic symptoms were assessed using a previously validated screening measure, with scores >= 3 indicative of possible psychotic disorder. Associations between this indicator and patterns of offending, common symptoms of mental disorders and health risk behaviours, including substance use were examined. The extent to which substance use and psychotic symptoms remained associated after adjustment for possible confounding was evaluated. RESULTS: Thirteen percent screened positive for psychosis. Participants who screened positive for psychosis were more likely than those who did not to have: unstable housing; been expelled from school; a family history of substance use/mental health problems, and depressive symptoms. Amphetamine, sedative and cannabis dependence were all strongly associated with screening positive for psychosis. Screening positive remained significantly associated with amphetamine and sedative dependence, and daily cannabis and sedative use, in multivariable regressions. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: One in eight young offenders reported symptoms consistent with psychosis. Symptomatology was strongly associated with heavy use of a range of illicit drugs. Given the frequency of these symptoms and the potential for them to be related to or exacerbated by drug use, this study highlights the importance of co-ordinated alcohol and other drugs and mental health treatment for young offenders, both due to co-occurrence and given the possibility that treating SUDs may impact on mental health symptoms.

26085633|t|Inhibition of Cytohesins Protects against Genetic Models of Motor Neuron Disease.
26085633|a|Mutant genes that underlie Mendelian forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and biochemical investigations of genetic disease models point to potential driver pathophysiological events involving endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy. Several steps in these cell biological processes are known to be controlled physiologically by small ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) signaling. Here, we investigated the role of ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), cytohesins, in models of ALS. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of cytohesins protects motor neurons in vitro from proteotoxic insults and rescues locomotor defects in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of disease. Cytohesins form a complex with mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), a known cause of familial ALS, but this is not associated with a change in GEF activity or ARF activation. ER stress evoked by mutant SOD1 expression is alleviated by antagonism of cytohesin activity. In the setting of mutant SOD1 toxicity, inhibition of cytohesin activity enhances autophagic flux and reduces the burden of misfolded SOD1. These observations suggest that targeting cytohesins may have potential benefits for the treatment of ALS.

26086967|t|APR-246 overcomes resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin in ovarian cancer cells.
26086967|a|UNASSIGNED: Two main causes of platinum resistance are mutation in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 and drug-induced increase in intracellular glutathione concentration. Mutations in TP53 occur in about 50% of human tumors. APR-246 (PRIMA-1(MET)) is the first clinical-stage compound that reactivates mutant p53 and induces apoptosis. APR-246 is a prodrug that is converted to the active compound methylene quinuclidinone (MQ), a Michael acceptor that binds to cysteine residues in mutant p53 and restores its wild-type conformation. Here, we show that MQ also binds to cysteine in glutathione, thus decreasing intracellular free glutathione concentration. We also show that treatment with APR-246 completely restores the cisplatin and doxorubicin sensitivity to p53-mutant drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells. We propose that this unique ability of APR-246/MQ to bind to cysteines in both mutant p53 and glutathione has a key role in the resensitization as well as in the outstanding synergistic effects observed with APR-246 in combination with platinum compounds in ovarian cancer cell lines and primary cancer cells. However, MQ binding to cysteines in other targets, for example, thioredoxin reductase, may contribute as well. Strong synergy was also observed with the DNA-damaging drugs doxorubicin and gemcitabine, while additive effects were found with the taxane docetaxel. Our results provide a strong rationale for the ongoing clinical study with APR-246 in combination with platinum-based therapy in patients with p53-mutant recurrent high-grade serous (HGS) ovarian cancer. More than 96% of these patients carry TP53 mutations. Combined treatment with APR-246 and platinum or other DNA-damaging drugs could allow dramatically improved therapy of a wide range of therapy refractory p53 mutant tumors.

26086566|t|A novel diagnostic index combining HE4, CA125 and age may improve triage of women with suspected ovarian cancer - An international multicenter study in women with an ovarian mass.
26086566|a|UNASSIGNED: Aim To develop and validate a biomarker-based index to optimize referral and diagnosis of patients with suspected ovarian cancer. Furthermore, to compare this new index with the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) and Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA). Patients and methods A training study, consisting of patients with benign ovarian disease (n=809) and ovarian cancer (n=246), was used to develop the Copenhagen Index (CPH-I) utilizing the variables serum HE4, serum CA125 and patient age. Eight international studies provided the validation population; comprising 1060 patients with benign ovarian masses and 550 patients with ovarian cancer. RESULTS: Overall, 2665 patients were included. CPH-I was highly significant in discriminating benign from malignant ovarian disease. At the defined cut-off=0.070 for CPH-I the sensitivity and specificity were 95.0% and 78.4% respectively in the training cohort and 82.0% and 88.4% in the validation cohort. Comparison of CPH-I, ROMA and RMI demonstrated Area-Under-Curve (AUC) at 0.960, 0.954 and 0.959 respectively in the training study and 0.951, 0.953 and 0.935 respectively in the validation study. Using a sensitivity of 95.0%, the specificities for CPH-I, ROMA and RMI in the training cohort were 78.4%, 71.7% and 81.5% respectively, and in the validation cohort 67.3%, 70.7% and 69.5% respectively. CONCLUSION: All three indices perform well at the clinically relevant sensitivity=95%, but CPH-I, unlike RMI and ROMA, is independent of ultrasound and menopausal status, and may provide a simple index to optimize referral of women with suspected ovarian cancer.

26086767|t|A Novel Trypanosoma cruzi Protein Associated to the Flagellar Pocket of Replicative Stages and Involved in Parasite Growth.
26086767|a|UNASSIGNED: The flagellar pocket constitutes an active and strategic site in the body of trypanosomatids (i.e. parasitic protozoa that cause important human and/or livestock diseases), which participates in several important processes such as cell polarity, morphogenesis and replication. Most importantly, the flagellar pocket is the unique site of surface protein export and nutrient uptake in trypanosomatids, and thus constitutes a key portal for the interaction with the host. In this work, we identified and characterized a novel Trypanosoma cruzi protein, termed TCLP 1, that accumulates at the flagellar pocket area of parasite replicative forms, as revealed by biochemical, immuno-cytochemistry and electron microscopy techniques. Different in silico analyses revealed that TCLP 1 is the founding member of a family of chimeric molecules restricted to trypanosomatids bearing, in addition to eukaryotic ubiquitin-like and protein-protein interacting domains, a motif displaying significant structural homology to bacterial multi-cargo chaperones involved in the secretion of virulence factors. Using the fidelity of an homologous expression system we confirmed TCLP 1 sub-cellular distribution and showed that TCLP 1-over-expressing parasites display impaired survival and accelerated progression to late stationary phase under starvation conditions. The reduced endocytic capacity of TCLP 1-over-expressors likely underlies (at least in part) this growth phenotype. TCLP 1 is involved in the uptake of extracellular macromolecules required for nutrition and hence in T. cruzi growth. Due to the bacterial origin, sub-cellular distribution and putative function(s), we propose TCLP 1 and related orthologs in trypanosomatids as appealing therapeutic targets for intervention against these health-threatening parasites.

26086690|t|Place as a predictor of health insurance coverage: A multivariate analysis of counties in the United States.
26086690|a|UNASSIGNED: This study assessed the importance of county characteristics in explaining county-level variations in health insurance coverage. Using public databases from 2008 to 2012, we studied 3112 counties in the United States. Rates of uninsurance ranged widely from 3% to 53%. Multivariate analysis suggested that poverty, unemployment, Republican voting, and percentages of Hispanic and American Indian/Alaskan Native residents in a county were significant predictors of uninsurance rates. The associations between uninsurance rates and both race/ethnicity and poverty varied significantly between metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. Collaborative actions by the federal, tribal, state, and county governments are needed to promote coverage and access to care.

It also causes direct and indirect economic losses due to health expenses and as a result of workforce loss. Management of this disease consists of pharmacological and nonpharmacological modalities. Until recently, pharmacological treatment options have been very limited. However, development of novel biological drugs revolutionized the management of this disease. The aim of this review article is to present an updated overview of the pharmacologic treatment of ankylosing spondylitis.

26086699|t|CuFe2O4 magnetic nanocrystal clusters as a matrix for the analysis of small molecules by negative-ion matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
26086699|a|UNASSIGNED: CuFe2O4 magnetic nanocrystal clusters (CuFe2O4 MNCs) were proposed as a new matrix for small molecule analysis by negative ion matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the first time. We demonstrated its advantages over conventional organic matrices in the detection of small molecules such as amino acids, peptides, nucleobases, fatty acids, and steroid hormones. A systematic comparison of CuFe2O4 MNCs with different ionization modes revealed that MS spectra obtained for the CuFe2O4 MNC matrix in the negative ion mode was only featured by deprotonated ion peaks with a free matrix background, which was different from the complicated alkali metal adducts produced in the positive ion mode. The developed method was found relatively tolerant to salt contamination and exhibited good reproducibility. A detection limit down to the subpicomolar level was achieved when testosterone was analyzed. In addition, by comparison of the MS spectra obtained from bare Fe3O4 and MFe2O4 MNC (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) matrices, two main factors of MFe2O4 MNC matrices were revealed to play a vital role in assisting the negative ion desorption/ionization (D/I) process: doping transition metals into ferrite nanocrystals favoring laser absorption and energy transfer and a good match between the UV absorption of MFe2O4 MNCs and the excitation of nitrogen laser source facilitating LDI efficiency. This work creates a new branch of application for MFe2O4 MNCs and provides an alternative solution for small molecule analysis.

26085832|t|Allergy immunotherapy prescribing trends for grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis in Germany: a retrospective cohort analysis.
26085832|a|BACKGROUND: Allergy immunotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with allergic rhinitis whose symptoms are unresolved with pharmacotherapy. Allergy immunotherapy for grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis is available in three modalities: subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual immunotherapy as a tablet or drop. This study aimed to understand trends in allergy immunotherapy prescribing and practice patterns for grass allergies in adult and paediatric patients in Germany. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using IMS Disease Analyzer in Germany. Patients with an allergy immunotherapy prescription for grass pollen (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] classification code V01AA02) from September 2005 to December 2012 were included in the study. General Practitioners (GPs), dermatologists, Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT)-specialists, paediatricians and pneumologists were included as the allergy immunotherapy prescribing physicians in the study. Descriptive analyses were conducted on patient characteristics at index and prescribing physician specialty; a test for trend was conducted for timing of initiation of first allergy immunotherapy prescription in each annual prescribing season. RESULTS: Eighteen thousand eight hundred fifty eligible patients were identified during the study period. The majority of patients received subcutaneous immunotherapy; however, the proportion of patients receiving sublingual immunotherapy tablets increased from 8  % in 2006/2007 to 29  % in 2011/2012 (p   <   0.001). Initiation of subcutaneous immunotherapy and Oralair   generally peaked during each prescribing year in two seasons (September-October and January) while GRAZAX   prescriptions peaked in autumn (September-October). ENT-specialists and dermatologists were the largest allergy immunotherapy prescribers in adults, while paediatricians and ENT-specialists were the largest prescribers of allergy immunotherapy in paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous immunotherapy remained the dominant allergy immunotherapy modality for grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis in Germany for adult and paediatric patients; however, there was a marked increase in proportion of patients receiving sublingual immunotherapy tablets from 2006/2007 to 2011/2012, after their introduction to the market in 2006. ENT-specialists, dermatologists and paediatricians were responsible for the majority of prescribing. The predominance of particular modalities within certain physician specialties likely reflects different treatment goals or needs.

26017070|t|Overall survival differences between patients with inflammatory and noninflammatory breast cancer presenting with distant metastasis at diagnosis.
26017070|a|UNASSIGNED: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive disease. Previous studies have shown that among patients with stage III breast cancer, IBC is associated with a worse prognosis than noninflammatory breast cancer (non-IBC). Whether this difference holds true among patients with stage IV breast cancer has not been studied. We tested the hypothesis that overall survival (OS) is worse in patients with IBC than in those with non-IBC among patients with distant metastasis at diagnosis (stage IV disease). We reviewed the records of 1504 consecutive patients with stage IV breast cancer (IBC: 206; non-IBC: 1298) treated at our institution from 1987 through 2012. Survival curves for IBC and non-IBC subcohorts were compared. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine predictors of OS. The median follow-up period was 4.7  years. IBC was associated with shorter median OS time than non-IBC (2.27 vs. 3.40  years; P  =  0.0128, log-rank test). In a multicovariate Cox model that included 1389 patients, the diagnosis of IBC was a significant independent predictor of worse OS  (hazard ratio  =  1.431, P  =  0.0011). Other significant predictors of worse OS included Black (vs. White) ethnicity, younger age at diagnosis, negative HER2 status, and visceral (vs. nonvisceral) site of metastasis. IBC is associated with shorter OS than non-IBC in patients with distant metastasis at diagnosis. The prognostic impact of IBC should be taken into consideration among patients with stage IV breast cancer.

26087936|t|Four new ginsenosides from red ginseng with inhibitory activity on melanogenesis in melanoma cells.
26087936|a|UNASSIGNED: During a search for novel melanogenesis inhibitors originating from nature sources, four new ginsenosides, including three dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins, 20(S)-ginsenoside-Rf-1a (1), 20Z-ginsenoside-Rs4 (2), 23-O-methylginsenoside-Rg11 (3), and one oleanane-type saponin, ginsenoside-Ro-6'-O-butyl ester (4) were isolated from red ginseng (the steamed ginseng) to evaluate their protective effects against melanogenesis. Compounds 2 and 3 exhibited potent inhibitory effects against both melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity in a dose-dependent manner in the a-MSH-stimulated B16 melanoma cells, and were more potent than the positive control arbutin, a well-known tyrosinase inhibitor. The results indicated that just the two carbon-20(22) double-bond-type ginsenosides showed strong inhibiting activity on melanogenesis through reducing tyrosinase activity. Thus, ginsenosides with such similar chemical structure in red ginseng may be potential natural products as tyrosinase inhibitors against malignant melanoma.

26087966|t|Steady state preparative multiple dual mode counter-current chromatography: Productivity and selectivity. Theory and experimental verification.
26087966|a|UNASSIGNED: In the steady state (SS) multiple dual mode (MDM) counter-current chromatography (CCC), at the beginning of the first step of every cycle the sample dissolved in one of the phases is continuously fed into a CCC device over a constant time, not exceeding the run time of the first step. After a certain number of cycles, the steady state regime is achieved, where concentrations vary over time during each cycle, however, the concentration profiles of solutes eluted with both phases remain constant in all subsequent cycles. The objective of this work was to develop analytical expressions to describe the SS MDM CCC separation processes, which can be helpful to simulate and design these processes and select a suitable compromise between the productivity and the selectivity in the preparative and production CCC separations. Experiments carried out using model mixtures of compounds from the GUESSmix with solvent system hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water demonstrated a reasonable agreement between the predictions of the theory and the experimental results.

26012745|t|Visual system evolution and the nature of the ancestral snake.
26012745|a|UNASSIGNED: The dominant hypothesis for the evolutionary origin of snakes from 'lizards' (non-snake squamates) is that stem snakes acquired many snake features while passing through a profound burrowing (fossorial) phase. To investigate this, we examined the visual pigments and their encoding opsin genes in a range of squamate reptiles, focusing on fossorial lizards and snakes. We sequenced opsin transcripts isolated from retinal cDNA and used microspectrophotometry to measure directly the spectral absorbance of the photoreceptor visual pigments in a subset of samples. In snakes, but not lizards, dedicated fossoriality (as in Scolecophidia and the alethinophidian Anilius scytale) corresponds with loss of all visual opsins other than RH1 (  max 490-497  nm); all other snakes (including less dedicated burrowers) also have functional sws1 and lws opsin genes. In contrast, the retinas of all lizards sampled, even highly fossorial amphisbaenians with reduced eyes, express functional lws, sws1, sws2 and rh1 genes, and most also express rh2 (i.e. they express all five of the visual opsin genes present in the ancestral vertebrate). Our evidence of visual pigment complements suggests that the visual system of stem snakes was partly reduced, with two (RH2 and SWS2) of the ancestral vertebrate visual pigments being eliminated, but that this did not extend to the extreme additional loss of SWS1 and LWS that subsequently occurred (probably independently) in highly fossorial extant scolecophidians and A.  scytale. We therefore consider it unlikely that the ancestral snake was as fossorial as extant scolecophidians, whether or not the latter are para- or monophyletic.

26073875|t|B-cell Activating Factor: An Orchestrator of Lymphoid Follicles in Severe COPD.
26073875|a|BACKGROUND: COPD patients have increased pulmonary lymphoid follicle (LF) counts. B-cell activating factor of TNF family (BAFF) regulates B-cells in health, but its role in COPD pathogenesis is unclear. METHODS: We correlated BAFF immunostaining in LFs in lung explants or biopsies from non-smoking controls (NSC), smokers without COPD (SC), and COPD patients, with the number and size of LFs, and LF B-cell apoptosis, activation, and proliferation. We analyzed serum BAFF levels and BAFF expression in B-cells in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from the same subject groups. We assessed whether: 1) cigarette smoke extract (CSE) increases B-cell BAFF expression; and 2) recombinant BAFF (rBAFF) rescues B-cells from CSE-induced apoptosis by inhibiting activation of nuclear factor k B (NF-kB). RESULTS: GOLD stage IV COPD patients had increased numbers and larger pulmonary LFs compared with GOLD stages I-II COPD patients and SC. We identified two main types of pulmonary LFs: 1) type A, the predominant type in GOLD stages I-II COPD and SC, characterized by abundant apoptotic but few BAFF-positive cells (mostly B-cells); and 2) type B, the main type in GOLD stage IV COPD, characterized by abundant BAFF-positive cells but few apoptotic cells (mostly B-cells). BAFF levels were also higher in blood and BAL B-cells in COPD patients versus NSC and SC. Surprisingly, rBAFF blocked CSE-induced B-cell apoptosis by inhibiting CSE-induced NF-kB activation. CONCLUSION: Our data support the hypothesis that B-cell BAFF expression creates a self-perpetuating loop contributing to COPD progression by promoting pulmonary B-cell survival and LF expansion.

26083002|t|The opinions and attitudes of dental school academic staff towards oral healthcare education for older adults.
26083002|a|UNASSIGNED: The term 'oral health care for older adults' has various interpretations, and its meaning is not clear among dental school academic staff. Additionally, there are no theoretical or practical stand-alone courses on oral health care for older adults in Japanese dental schools. To improve oral health care education, we investigated the opinions and attitudes toward oral health care education for older adults among academic staff in dental schools. Data were collected in seven dental schools from May to September 2013 via an online questionnaire survey. Five-hundred-fifty-eight academics (428 male, 130 female) participated (response rate 57%). The average number of years since they had completed a university degree was 20.2 (SD 10.2) years. The majority (Over 90%) of participants perceived that oral health care should be provided in nursing facilities, hospitals, and at home. Its treatments and instructions should include, not only methods of keeping good oral hygiene, but also improvement of oral function such as swallowing training and salivary glands massage. The majority (84.2%) suggested oral health care education should be combined as a one-credit, stand-alone course. Findings indicate that dental academics have an understanding the need for a course in oral health care for older adults. Participants supported the need for further development of education in oral health care for older adults' in Japan, as a separate course on its own right. However there were some different views about content by teaching field. The need for a national core program for teaching oral health care education was suggested.

26081237|t|[Application of anti-VEGF agents in treatment of neovascular glaucoma and anti-scarring in filtering surgery].
26081237|a|Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a group of secondary glaucoma which led by a variety of diseases that have anoxia or ischemia to the retina. Some studies have found that the etiology was related to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). At present, anti-VEGF as a treatment method to NVG, has become an important advance in the field of glaucoma research, which established a new way to improve the prognosis. This review mainly focused on the pathophysiologic basis and clinical research of NVG, fundamental research and applications about four kinds of anti-VEGF agents (Bevacizumab, Ranibizumab, Pegaptanib and Aflibercept) and application of treatment of NVG and anti-scarring in filtering surgery. The review also provided references for the clinical treatment of NVG and improving the success rate of operation.

26096159|t|Insights into the virulence-related genes of Edwardsiella tarda isolated from turbot in Europe: genetic homogeneity and evidence for vibrioferrin production.
26096159|a|UNASSIGNED: Edwardsiella tarda has long been known as a pathogen that causes severe economic losses in aquaculture industry. Insights gained on E.  tarda pathogenesis may prove useful in the development of new methods for the treatment of infections as well as preventive measures against future outbreaks. In this report, we have established the correlation between the presence of virulence genes, related with three aspects typically involved in bacterial pathogenesis (chondroitinase activity, quorum sensing and siderophore-mediated ferric uptake systems), in the genome of E.  tarda strains isolated from turbot in Europe and their phenotypic traits. A total of 8 genes were tested by PCR for their presence in 73 E.  tarda isolates. High homogeneity was observed in the presence/absence pattern of all the strains. Positive results in the amplification of virulence-related genes were correlated with the detection of chondroitinase activity in agar plates, in  vivo AHL production during fish infection and determination of type of siderophore produced by E.  tarda. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study carried out with European strains on potential virulence factors. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that E.  tarda produces the siderophore vibrioferrin.

26095015|t|The relationship between cognitive insight and depression in psychosis and schizophrenia: A review and meta-analysis.
26095015|a|UNASSIGNED: Lack of insight is a commonly observed problem in patients with psychosis and schizophrenia. Clinical insight in patients has been associated with low mood. Cognitive insight is a recently defined concept, relating to the ability to self-reflect and the degree to which patients are over-confident regarding their interpretations of illness-related experiences, and is related to clinical insight. We therefore sought to investigate whether there is a positive relationship between cognitive insight and mood. A literature search identified 17 relevant papers published between 2004 and 2014. Our analysis indicated that there was a small but significant positive correlation between the composite index (CI) of the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) and depression scores, but this was driven by a significant positive relationship between depression and the BCIS self-reflection (SR) sub-scale, where low mood was related to higher SR scores. There was no significant relationship between the self-certainty sub-scale and depression. Post-hoc analysis indicated that different depression scales did not significantly affect the relationship with SR. Our results support the idea that cognitive insight is significantly related to mood in schizophrenia, and the effect size is similar to that between clinical insight and mood. Potential applications of this knowledge into treatment and rehabilitation are discussed and a model of cognitive insight is proposed.

Recently, we have reported that the anti-cancer activity of copper (II) pyrithione CuPT and gold (I) complex auranofin is associated with targeting the 19S proteasome-associated deubiquitinases (DUBs), UCHL5 and USP14. Here we discuss metal DUB inhibitors in treating cancer and other diseases. (from Editor). Several copper and gold complexes have clinical activity in treating some human diseases including cancer. Recently, we have reported that the anti-cancer activity of copper (II) pyrithione CuPT and gold (I) complex auranofin is tightly associated with their ability to target and inhibit the 19S proteasome-associated deubiquitinases (DUBs), UCHL5 and USP14. In this article we review small molecule inhibitors of DUBs and 19S proteasome-associated DUBs. We then describe and discuss the ubique nature of CuPT and auranofin, which is inhibition of 19S proteasome-associated UCHL5 and USP14. We finally suggest the potential to develop novel, specific metal-based DUB inhibitors for treating cancer and other diseases.

26075855|t|[Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state].
26075855|a|UNASSIGNED: The hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) is a serious acute complication of diabetes decompensation, especially in type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and with critical prognosis. Primary characteristics of HHS include extreme hyperglycemia, severe dehydration (with prerenal hyperazotaemia), plasma hyperosmolarity, frequent disorders of consciousness, absent or minimum ketoacidosis (with higher values, only found in combined forms). Both DKA and HHS have a common pathogenetic mechanism, but both states are opposite extreme deviations, and the boundaries between them are not entirely clear. Significant hyperglycemia is at the forefront of HHS, while ketoacidosis dominates in DKA. Various etiopathogenic mechanisms of the onset and development of HHS are discussed, but a clear explanation of the absence of ketoacidosis in HHS is lacking. The most frequent cause of HHS is serious cardiovascular disease, acute stroke, particularly genitourinary and/or respiratory infections, conditions preventing the patient from adequate water intake during osmotic diuresis, the consequences of inappropriate medication therapy, social conditions, and last but not least, it is often the first manifestation especially in type 2 diabetes. The clinical picture is influenced mainly by dehydration, while circulatory changes can lead to heart or circulatory failure and renal insufficiency. HHS is the cause of frequent disturbances of consciousness, and a cerebrovascular event should always be considered. Given the seriousness of HHS prognosis, timely comprehensive and properly guided therapy is of major prognostic significance. HHS treatment (rehydration, insulin therapy, ion substitution) is governed by similar rules as the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, but it also varies in many respects. Particular attention should be paid mainly to the control of dehydration. The patient with HHS should always be admitted to the intensive care unit. The most serious complications include cardiovascular complications, acute renal failure, thrombotic events and infectious complications. Given the still high mortality of patients with HHS the research focuses not only on the uncertainties concerning etiopathogenesis, but particularly on establishing safe and effective therapeutic strategies.Key words: diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - HHS therapy - hyperglycemia - hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) - pathogenetic mechanisms of HHS.

26076493|t|Attenuated Neural Processing of Risk in Young Adults at Risk for Stimulant Dependence.
26076493|a|OBJECTIVE: Approximately 10% of young adults report non-medical use of stimulants (cocaine, amphetamine, methylphenidate), which puts them at risk for the development of dependence. This fMRI study investigates whether subjects at early stages of stimulant use show altered decision making processing. METHODS: 158 occasional stimulants users (OSU) and 50 comparison subjects (CS) performed a "risky gains" decision making task during which they could select safe options (cash in 20 cents) or gamble them for double or nothing in two consecutive gambles (win or lose 40 or 80 cents, "risky decisions"). The primary analysis focused on risky versus safe decisions. Three secondary analyses were conducted: First, a robust regression examined the effect of lifetime exposure to stimulants and marijuana; second, subgroups of OSU with >1000 (n = 42), or <50 lifetime marijuana uses (n = 32), were compared to CS with <50 lifetime uses (n = 46) to examine potential marijuana effects; third, brain activation associated with behavioral adjustment following monetary losses was probed. RESULTS: There were no behavioral differences between groups. OSU showed attenuated activation across risky and safe decisions in prefrontal cortex, insula, and dorsal striatum, exhibited lower anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsal striatum activation for risky decisions and greater inferior frontal gyrus activation for safe decisions. Those OSU with relatively more stimulant use showed greater dorsal ACC and posterior insula attenuation. In comparison, greater lifetime marijuana use was associated with less neural differentiation between risky and safe decisions. OSU who chose more safe responses after losses exhibited similarities with CS relative to those preferring risky options. DISCUSSION: Individuals at risk for the development of stimulant use disorders presented less differentiated neural processing of risky and safe options. Specifically, OSU show attenuated brain response in regions critical for performance monitoring, reward processing and interoceptive awareness. Marijuana had additive effects by diminishing neural risk differentiation.

26074063|t|Studies of the binding of ficolin-2 and ficolin-3 from the complement lectin pathway to Leptospira biflexa, Pasteurella pneumotropica and Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli.
26074063|a|UNASSIGNED: Ficolins recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns and activate the lectin pathway of complement system. However, our knowledge regarding pathogen recognition of human ficolins is still limited. We therefore set out to explore and investigate the possible interactions of the two main serum ficolins, ficolin-2 and ficolin-3 with different Gram-negative bacteria. We used recombinant ficolin molecules and normal human serum, which were detected with anti-ficolin monoclonal antibodies. In addition we investigated the capacity of these pathogens to activate the lectin pathway of complement system. We show for the first time that human ficolin-2 recognizes the nonpathogenic spirochete Leptospira biflexa serovar Patoc, but not the pathogenic Leptospira interrogans serovar Kennewicki strain Fromm. Additionally, human ficolin-2 and ficolin-3 recognize pathogenic Pasteurella pneumotropica, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) serotype O111ab:H2 and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) serogroup O71 but not four enterohemorrhagic E. coli, three EPEC, three EAEC and two nonpathogenic E. coli strains (DH5a and HB101). The lectin pathway was activated by Pasteurella pneumotropica, EPEC O111ab:H2 and EAEC O71 after incubation with C1q depleted human serum. In conclusion, this study provide novel insight in the binding and complement activating capacity of the lectin pathway initiation molecules ficolin-2 and ficolin-3 towards relevant Gram-negative pathogens of pathophysiological relevance.

26075202|t|A top-down view of the tumor microenvironment: structure, cells and signaling.
26075202|a|It is well established that the tumor microenvironment (TME) contributes to cancer progression. Stromal cells can be divided into mesenchymal, vascular, and immune. Signaling molecules secreted by the tumor corrupts these cells to create "activated" stroma. Equally, the extracellular matrix (ECM) contributes to tumor development and invasion by forming a biologically active scaffold. In this review we describe the key structural, cellular and signaling components of the TME with a perspective on stromal soluble factors and microRNAs (miRNAs).

26059645|t|A field survey of the partially edentate elderly: Investigation of factors related to the usage rate of removable partial dentures.
26059645|a|UNASSIGNED: Although the shortened dental arch (SDA) concept has been known to all over the world, acceptance of the SDA concept as an oral health standard can be questionable from the patients' point of view, even if it is biologically reasonable. Furthermore, because the health insurance system covers removable partial dentures (RPDs) for all citizens in Japan, SDA patients seem to prefer to receive prosthetic treatment to replace the missing teeth. However, there were few field surveys to investigate the usage rate of RPDs in Japan. The purpose of this study was to determine the usage rate of RPDs in older Japanese subjects and to investigate the factors related to the usage of RPDs. Partially edentate participants (n  =  390) were included in this study. Oral examinations were conducted to record several indices. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to evaluate the relationship between the number of missing teeth and the usage rate of RPDs. Chi-squared tests and logistic regression analysis were conducted to evaluate the factors related to the usage rate of RPDs. Usage of RPDs had a significantly positive association with the number of missing distal extension teeth and bilaterally missing teeth. The usage rate of RPDs increased as the number of missing distal extension teeth increased (P for trend  <  0  001). The conclusion of this study was that participants with missing distal extension teeth had higher usage rates of RPDs than other participants, and the usage rate increased as the number of missing distal extension teeth increased.

26045897|t|Inhibiting the mobilization of Ly6C(high) monocytes after acute myocardial infarction enhances the efficiency of mesenchymal stromal cell transplantation and curbs myocardial remodeling.
26045897|a|BACKGROUND: Ischemia related inflammation is the most critical factor for the survival of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and strategies for controlling excessive inflammation after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are essential and necessary for cell transplantation therapy. Our present study tested the effect of decreased Ly6C(high) monocytes on mouse MSCs transplantation after AMI. METHODS: BALB/c AMI mice were treated systemically with a CCR2 antagonist (RS 504393, 2 mg/kg, subcutaneously) or normal saline (control group). Next, 10(5) EdU-labeled MSCs were administered by intramyocardial injection to the mice in each group. TUNEL kits were used to identify the apoptotic cardiomyocytes in the infarct. The slides of the infarct border zone were stained with wheat germ agglutinin to measure the vessel density, and anti-myosin heavy chain eFluor 660 was used to measure the cardiac myosin-positive area. A transwell chamber was used to examine the interactions between Ly6C(high) monocytes and MSCs. The inflammatory cytokines expressed by Ly6C(high) monocytes and the SDF-1 expressed by MSCs were detected using ELISA kits. MSC viability was further examined by MTT and mitochondrial membrane potential assays by flow cytometry using JC-1 kits. RESULTS: We first observed the increased survival of transplanted MSCs (11.2    3.4/mm(2) vs. 3.5    1.6/mm(2), p < 0.001), and the decreased apoptosis of cardiomyocytes (11.20%    3.55% vs. 20.51%    8.17%, p < 0.001) in the infarcts at 3 days in the CCR2 antagonist group. An increased number of capillaries and small arterioles (139.6    21.7/mm(2) vs. 95.4    17.6/mm(2), p < 0.001) and an increased cardiac myosin-positive area (17.9%    6.6% vs. 11.8%    3.5%, p < 0.001) were also observed in the infarct zone at 21 days post MSC infusion in the CCR2 antagonist group. In addition, a significantly increased LvEF% (50.17    10.06 vs. 45.44    9.45, p < 0.001) was detected at the same time compared to the control mice. We further demonstrated that both the mitochondrial membrane potential of the MSCs (0.45    0.11 vs. 3.4    0.3, p < 0.001) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) secreted by the MSCs significantly decreased (80.77    39.02 pg/ml vs. 435.5    77.41 pg/ml, p < 0.001) when co-cultured with Ly6C(high) monocytes. This is possibly mediated by the over-expressed cytokines secreted by the Ly6C(high) monocytes compared to the Ly6C(low) monocytes, including IL-1 (139.45    30.44 vs. 80.05    19.33, p < 0.001), IL-6 (187.82    40.43 vs. 135.5    22.09, p < 0.001), TNF-a (121.77    31.65 vs. 75.3    22.14, p < 0.001) and IFN-y (142.46    27.55 vs. 88.25    19.91, p < 0.001).

26096578|t|Frequency of body dysmorphic disorder among patients with complaints of hair loss.
26096578|a|BACKGROUND: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a psychiatric condition in which a disabling preoccupation with a non-existent or slight defect in appearance is the main symptom. Hair concerns are frequent in patients with BDD. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of BDD among patients with complaints of hair loss. METHODS: A validated BDD questionnaire (BDDQ) was administered to 150 patients with complaints of hair loss and 150 control subjects who were selected from among general dermatology (GD) patients. Standard statistical tests were performed (descriptive analysis, chi-squared tests, non-parametric tests). Differences that achieved a P-value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Among patients with complaints of hair loss, 42 of 142 subjects retained in the study (29.6%; 31 females and 11 males) were diagnosed with BDD. Furthermore, 25.6% of female patients and 52.4% of male patients were diagnosed with BDD (P  =  0.013). Hair concerns were more common in males than in females (P  <  0.05). In the GD group, four control subjects (2.7%, all female) were diagnosed with BDD; all of their concerns focused on the body and acne. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of BDD is about 10 times higher in patients with complaints of hair loss than it is in GD patients and is higher in males. Awareness of the condition and the referral of selected patients to mental health professionals is crucial.

26010902|t|Architecture, Assembly, and Emerging Applications of Branched Functional Polyelectrolytes and Poly(ionic liquid)s.
26010902|a|UNASSIGNED: Branched polyelectrolytes with cylindrical brush, dendritic, hyperbranched, grafted, and star architectures bearing ionizable functional groups possess complex and unique assembly behavior in solution at surfaces and interfaces as compared to their linear counterparts. This review summarizes the recent developments in the introduction of various architectures and understanding of the assembly behavior of branched polyelectrolytes with a focus on functional polyelectrolytes and poly(ionic liquid)s with responsive properties. The branched polyelectrolytes and poly(ionic liquid)s interact electrostatically with small molecules, linear polyelectrolytes, or other branched polyelectrolytes to form assemblies of hybrid nanoparticles, multilayer thin films, responsive microcapsules, and ion-conductive membranes. The branched structures lead to unconventional assemblies and complex hierarchical structures with responsive properties as summarized in this review. Finally, we discuss prospectives for emerging applications of branched polyelectrolytes and poly(ionic liquid)s for energy harvesting and storage, controlled delivery, chemical microreactors, adaptive surfaces, and ion-exchange membranes.

26044740|t|Chiral separation of D/L-aldoses by micellar electrokinetic chromatography using a chiral derivatization reagent and a phenylboronic acid complex.
26044740|a|UNASSIGNED: A novel method was developed for D/L-isomeric separation of aldopentoses and aldohexoses as their (S)-(+)-4-(N,N-dimethylaminosulfonyl)-7-(3-aminopyrrolidin-1-yl)-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole derivatives using phenylboronate buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate as a background electrolyte. The combination of derivatization with a chiral labeling reagent and micellar electrokinetic chromatography with phenylboronate made possible the efficient separation of D/L isomers as well as epimeric isomers of aldopentoses and aldohexoses. Laser-induced fluorescence detection permitted the micromolar-level determination of monosaccharide derivatives. The limit of detection was 105 amol (300  nM), and the repeatabilities of the migration times and peak area responses were 0.8  % and 7.9  % (relative standard deviation; n   =   6), respectively. The method was applied to the determination of D/L- galactose in red seaweed.

26042356|t|Controlling the electrical transport properties of nanocontacts to nanowires.
26042356|a|UNASSIGNED: The ability to control the properties of electrical contacts to nanostructures is essential to realize operational nanodevices. Here, we show that the electrical behavior of the nanocontacts between free-standing ZnO nanowires and the catalytic Au particle used for their growth can switch from Schottky to Ohmic depending on the size of the Au particles in relation to the cross-sectional width of the ZnO nanowires. We observe a distinct Schottky-to-Ohmic transition in transport behavior at an Au-to-nanowire diameter ratio of 0.6. The current-voltage electrical measurements performed with a multi-probe instrument are explained using 3-D self-consistent electrostatic and transport simulations revealing that tunneling at the contact edge is the dominant carrier transport mechanism for these nanoscale contacts. The results are applicable to other nanowire materials such as Si, GaAs, and InAs when the effects of surface charge and contact size are considered.

26059170|t|WITHDRAWN: Topical negative pressure for treating chronic wounds.
26059170|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic wounds mainly affect the elderly and those with multiple health problems. Despite the use of modern dressings, some of these wounds take a long time to heal, fail to heal, or recur, causing significant pain and discomfort to the person and cost to health services. Topical negative pressure (TNP) is used to promote healing of surgical wounds by using suction to drain excess fluid from wounds. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of TNP on chronic wound healing. SEARCH METHODS: For this second update of this review we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (December 2007), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) - The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2007, Ovid MEDLINE - 1950 to November Week 2 2007, Ovid EMBASE - 1982 to 2007 Week 50 and Ovid CINAHL - 1980 to December Week 1 2007. In addition, we contacted authors, companies, manufacturers, and distributors to identify relevant trials and information. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials which evaluated the effects of TNP on people with chronic wounds. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Selection of the trials, quality assessment, data abstraction, and data synthesis were done by two authors independently. Disagreements were solved by discussion. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials were included in the original review. A further five trials were included in this second update resulting in a total of seven trials involving 205 participants.The seven trials compared TNP with five different comparator treatments. Four trials compared TNP with gauze soaked in either 0.9% saline or Ringer's solution. The other three trials compared TNP with hydrocolloid gel plus gauze, a treatment package comprising papain-urea topical treatment, and cadexomer iodine or hydrocolloid, hydrogels, alginate and foam. These data do not show that TNP significantly increases the healing rate of chronic wounds compared with comparators.Data on secondary outcomes such as infection rate, quality of life, oedema, hospitalisation and bacterial load were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Trials comparing TNP with alternative treatments for chronic wounds have methodological flaws and data do demonstrate a beneficial effect of TNP on wound healing however more, better quality research is needed.

26060173|t|Type 1 diabetes: Syndromes in resource-challenged settings.
26060173|a|Type 1 Diabetes is a complex disorder that is made more complex by the myriad of co-morbid conditions associated with it. Mauriac Syndrome is a well-known but nowadays uncommon condition that presents with growth retardation secondary to poor glycaemic control. Limited Joint Mobility is an often-missed association of diabetes. Its importance lies in the fact that it can cause significant impairment of fine movements in T1DM children. It also indicates poor glycaemic control over a long period of time and can be used as a surrogate marker for development of diabetic microvascular complications. Anaemia in T1DM is protean and can develop due to a combination of nutritional factors, chronic renal disease, coeliac disease and worm infestation. Management is etiological. Vitamin deficiencies are ubiquitous in T1DM and if left untreated, can lead to neurological, haematological and skeletal dysfunction. The best-known co-morbid conditions are the local site reactions clubbed together under the moniker lipodystrophies. These can be either atrophic or hypertrophic and are usually due to repeated injections at the same site, improper technique and needle re-use. Management is often difficult and they are best prevented by appropriate diabetes education and emphasis on proper injection techniques at the time of T1DM diagnosis, with periodic reinforcement. Amyloidosis is a little known condition that shares a lot of features in common with the lipodystrophies and often needs to be differentiated from lipohypertrophy. T1DM is a disease which is often associated with a poor quality of life and these co-morbid conditions also need to be treated for effective general and psychological well-being.

26093472|t|Odontoblastic Differentiation, Inflammatory Response, and Angiogenic Potential of 4 Calcium Silicate-based Cements: Micromega MTA, ProRoot MTA, Retro MTA, and Experimental Calcium Silicate Cement.
26093472|a|INTROUDCTION: The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of different calcium silicate-based cements (CSCs) for pulp capping materials including MicroMega MTA (MMTA; MicroMega, Besanchon, France), Retro MTA (RMTA; BioMTA, Seoul, Korea), ProRoot MTA (PMTA; Dentsply, Tulsa, OK), and experimental CSC (ECSC) on odontoblastic differentiation, in  vitro angiogenesis, and the inflammatory response in human dental pulp cells. METHODS: Differentiation was evaluated by alkaline phosphatase activity, alizarin red staining, and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the marker genes. The levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines were measured by RT-PCR and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In  vitro angiogenesis was assessed by RT-PCR for angiogenic genes and an endothelial tube formation assay. RESULTS: PMTA, MMTA, and ECSC increased the alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization nodule formation and up-regulated messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of odontoblastic markers compared with RMTA. In addition, PMTA, MMTA, and ECSC up-regulated the mRNA of angiogenic genes in human dental pulp cells and increased the capillary tube formation of endothelial cells compared with RMTA. However, all CSCs showed similar expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein as well  as proinflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our experimental results suggest that all CSCs are favorable materials for pulp capping, but PMTA, MMTA, and ECSC may be recommended over RMTA.

26092752|t|Point-of-Care Testing: Future of Chronic Disease State Management?
26092752|a|UNASSIGNED: This article provides an overview of the current use of point-of-care testing (POCT) and its utility for patients' self-management of chronic disease states. Pharmacists utilize POCT to provide rapid laboratory diagnostic results as a monitoring tool in the management of their patients and in order to improve medication outcomes. Considerations for the transition to use of POCT in the home to further improve disease management and improve health care cost-effectiveness are discussed. Devices available for home use include those suitable for management of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and anticoagulation. Many of these devices include software capabilities enabling patients to share important health information with health care providers using a computer. Limitations and challenges surrounding implementation of home POCT for patients include reliability of instrumentation, ability to coordinate data collection, necessary training requirements, and cost-effectiveness. Looking forward, the successful integration of POCT into the homes of patients is contingent on a concerted effort made by all members of the health care team.

26048046|t|The Pathogenesis and Therapy of Muscular Dystrophies.
26048046|a|UNASSIGNED: Current molecular genomic approaches to human genetic disorders have led to an explosion in the identification of the genes and their encoded proteins responsible for these disorders. The identification of the gene altered by mutations in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy was one of the earliest examples of this paradigm. The nearly 30 years of research partly outlined here exemplifies the road that similar current gene discovery protocols will be expected to travel, albeit much more rapidly owing to improved diagnosis of genetic disorders and an understanding of the spectrum of mutations thought to cause them. The identification of the protein dystrophin has led to a new understanding of the muscle cell membrane and the proteins involved in membrane stability, as well as new candidate genes for additional forms of muscular dystrophy. Animal models identified with naturally occurring mutations and developed by genetic manipulation have furthered the understanding of disease progression and underlying pathology. The biochemistry and molecular analysis of patient samples have led to the different dystrophin-dependent and -independent therapies that are currently close to or in human clinical trials. The lessons learned from decades of research on dystrophin have benefited the field of human genetics. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics Volume 16 is August 31, 2015.

26044713|t|Age and sex differences of risk factors of activity limitations in Japanese older adults.
26044713|a|AIM: The objective of the present study was to verify how socioeconomic and physical/mental health status would be associated with activity limitations by age and sex among older adults, using nationally representative cross-sectional data in Japan. METHODS: The present study focused on 8373 older adults aged 65 years or older extracted from the Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions conducted in 2007 by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses and population-attributable risk were applied to validate the relationships of socioeconomic and physical/mental health status with activity limitations among the total population, and by age groups (young-old or old-old) and sex. RESULTS: Mental health showed the highest odds ratio and population-attributable risk in the total population. In addition, low back pain was associated with activity limitations regardless of age and sex. Other musculoskeletal diseases, such as arthropathy and osteoporosis, were related to activity limitations for women, regardless of age, whereas cardiovascular diseases, including angina pectoris/myocardial infarction and cerebral stroke, were associated with activity limitations for men in any age group. There were no statistically significant correlations between socioeconomic status and activity limitations in any groups. CONCLUSION: Mental health was the most important factor of activity limitations in Japanese older adults. Furthermore, low back pain regardless of age and sex, other musculoskeletal diseases only for women and cardiovascular diseases mainly for men could also be significant risk factors to activity limitations. Therefore, preventive approaches of activity limitations considering sex differences are important for older adults in Japan. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2015;       :       -      .

26037312|t|Residual force depression in single sarcomeres is abolished by MgADP-induced activation.
26037312|a|The mechanisms behind the shortening-induced force depression commonly observed in skeletal muscles remain unclear, but have been associated with sarcomere length non-uniformity and/or crossbridge inhibition. The purpose of this study was twofold: (i) to evaluate if force depression is present in isolated single sarcomeres, a preparation that eliminates sarcomere length non-uniformities and (ii) to evaluate if force depression is inhibited when single sarcomeres are activated with MgADP, which biases crossbridges into a strongly-bound state. Single sarcomeres (n   =   16) were isolated from rabbit psoas myofibrils using two micro-needles (one compliant, one rigid), piercing the sarcomere externally adjacent to the Z-lines. The sarcomeres were contracted isometrically and subsequently shortened, in both Ca(2+)- and MgADP-activating solutions. Shortening in Ca(2+)-activated samples resulted in a 27.44        9.04% force depression when compared to isometric contractions produced at similar final sarcomere lengths (P   <   0.001). There was no force depression in MgADP-activated sarcomeres (force depression   =   -1.79        9.69%, P   =    0.435). These results suggest that force depression is a sarcomeric property, and that is associated with an inhibition of myosin-actin interactions.

26037863|t|The effect of transient ischemic attack clinical pathway.
26037863|a|BACKGROUND: Clinical pathway (CP) of transient ischemic attack (TIA) is an interdisciplinary, comprehensive, standardized management model for medical care of TIA. It aims to standardize the procedure, reduce the cost, and improve the quality of medical care. However, its effect is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of TIA CP and provide evidence for control of medical care cost, optimize the structure of hospital cost, and make best use of medical resource. METHODS: 112 patients in the CP group and 179 patients in the nonclinical pathway (NCP) group were included in this nonconcurrent cohort study. RESULTS: The average length of stay was 9.55  3.89 days in the NCP group, and it was 7.26  2.09 days in the CP group. The average length of stay was significantly shortened by 2.29 days. Hospital cost in the CP group significantly increased by 7.9% (868 yuan) compared with that in the NCP group. The proportion of medication cost significantly decreased by 5%, while the proportion of examination cost significantly increased by 8%. As for the clinical outcomes of patients with TIA, 98.21% of the patients in the CP group were discharged in a good condition, while the proportion was 97.77% in the NCP group, and no significant difference was found between the improvement rate of the two groups. Eight patients (4%) in the NCP group were admitted to the hospital because of a 30-day recurrent TIA or cerebral infarction; four of them had cerebral infarction, whereas no recurrent TIA or cerebral infarction was found in the CP group at the 30-day follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of TIA CP could reduce the length of stay, the proportion of medication cost, and optimize the structure of hospital expense, thus making best use of medical resources and improve the quality of TIA medical care.

26095431|t|Autumnal increase in proportion of toxic Microcystis in Lake Taihu depends more on temperature adaptability than on effects of toxigenicity.
26095431|a|AIMS: Toxic Microcystis strains have selective advantages over non-toxic strains under certain conditions. This study was undertaken to analyze whether fluctuations of toxic/non-toxic ratio in Microcystis population are based on effects of toxigenicity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Annual Microcystis population dynamics was investigated by sequencing of gvpAC-IGS libraries and qPCR analysis of mcyA. gvpAC-IGS type 1 dominated the Microcystis population in Lake Taihu in seasons except autumn, while types 6, 9 and 10 and mcyA copies in total Microcystis rapidly increased in autumn and decreased in winter. Isolated type 6 was found to be toxic, while types 1, 9 and 10 were non-toxic. Physiological characterization and co-cultures indicated that type 1 was favored at lower temperatures when competing with types 6, 9 and 10. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid increase in proportion of toxic Microcystis was probably based on the same mechanism as that for other non-toxic strains to arise in total Microcystis. Fluctuations of toxic/non-toxic ratio are not necessarily due to effects of toxigenicity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report that the dynamics of toxic/non-toxic Microcystis was investigated in combination with characterizations of multiple isolated strains. The results are useful in understanding Microcystis genotype succession. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

26043425|t|Characterization of DNA substrate specificities of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
26043425|a|UNASSIGNED: Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases are key enzymes involved in the repair of abasic sites and DNA strand breaks. Pathogenic bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains two AP endonucleases: MtbXthA and MtbNfo members of the exonuclease III and endonuclease IV families, which are exemplified by Escherichia coli Xth and Nfo, respectively. It has been shown that both MtbXthA and MtbNfo contain AP endonuclease and 3' > 5' exonuclease activities. However, it remains unclear whether these enzymes hold 3'-repair phosphodiesterase and nucleotide incision repair (NIR) activities. Here, we report that both mycobacterial enzymes have 3'-repair phosphodiesterase and 3'-phosphatase, and MtbNfo contains in addition a very weak NIR activity. Interestingly, depending on pH, both enzymes require different concentrations of divalent cations: 0.5mM MnCl2 at pH 7.6 and 10mM at pH 6.5. MtbXthA requires a low ionic strength and 37  C, while MtbNfo requires high ionic strength (200mM KCl) and has a temperature optimum at 60  C. Point mutation analysis showed that D180 and N182 in MtbXthA and H206 and E129 in MtbNfo are critical for enzymes activities. The steady-state kinetic parameters indicate that MtbXthA removes 3'-blocking sugar-phosphate and 3'-phosphate moieties at DNA strand breaks with an extremely high efficiency (kcat/KM=440 and 1280 M(-1)   min(-1), respectively), while MtbNfo exhibits much lower 3'-repair activities (kcat/KM=0.26 and 0.65 M(-1)   min(-1), respectively). Surprisingly, both MtbXthA and MtbNfo exhibited very weak AP site cleavage activities, with kinetic parameters 100- and 300-fold lower, respectively, as compared with the results reported previously. Expression of MtbXthA and MtbNfo reduced the sensitivity of AP endonuclease-deficient E. coli xth nfo strain to methylmethanesulfonate and H2O2 to various degrees. Taken together, these data establish the DNA substrate specificity of M. tuberculosis AP endonucleases and suggest their possible role in the repair of oxidative DNA damage generated by endogenous and host- imposed factors.

26048579|t|Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination in adults undergoing immunosuppressive treatment for inflammatory diseases - a longitudinal study.
26048579|a|INTRODUCTION: Patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk of infection. Community-acquired pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease account for substantial morbidity and mortality in this population and may be prevented by vaccination. Ideally, immunization to pneumococcal antigens should take place before the start of immunosuppressive treatment. Often however the treatment cannot be delayed. Little is known about the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccine during immunosuppressive treatment. The objectives of this study are to determine the percentage of vaccine-na  ve immunosuppressed adults with inflammatory diseases seroprotected against Streptococcus pneumoniae and to assess factors associated with immunogenicity, clinical impact and safety of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) in seronegative subjects. METHODS: This observational study included patients >= 18 years old, receiving prednisone >= 20mg/day or other immunosuppressive drugs. Exclusion criteria were PPV administration in the previous 5 years, intravenous immunoglobulins and pregnancy. Serum IgG to six pneumococcal serotypes were measured. Seropositivity was defined as IgG >= 0,5ug/ml for >= 4/6 serotypes. Seronegative patients received PPV and seropositive patients were included as comparison group. Vaccine response and tolerance were assessed after 4-8 weeks. Disease activity was evaluated with the physician's global assessment score. Serology was repeated after one year and information on any kind of infections needing medical attention was collected. Outcomes were the proportion of seropositivity and infections between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. RESULTS: Of 201 included patients, 35 received high-dose corticosteroids and 181 immunosuppressive drugs. Baseline seronegativity in 60 (30 %) patients was associated with corticotherapy and lower total IgG. After PPV, disease activity remained unchanged or decreased in 81 % of patients, and 87 % became seropositive. After one year, 67 % of vaccinated compared to 90 % of observed patients were seropositive (p<0.001), while the rate of infections did not differ between groups. Those still taking prednisone >= 10mg/day tended to have poorer serological responses and had significantly more infections. CONCLUSIONS: PPV was safe, but moderately effective on serological response. Seropositivity to pneumococcal antigens significantly reduced the risk of infections. Sustained high-dose corticosteroids were associated with poor vaccine response and more infections.

26049492|t|Long-range interactions between polar bialkali ground-state molecules in arbitrary vibrational levels.
26049492|a|UNASSIGNED: We have calculated the isotropic C6 coefficients characterizing the long-range van der Waals interaction between two identical heteronuclear alkali-metal diatomic molecules in the same arbitrary vibrational level of their ground electronic state X(1)  (+). We consider the ten species made up of (7)Li, (23)Na, (39)K, (87)Rb, and (133)Cs. Following our previous work [Lepers et al., Phys. Rev. A 88, 032709 (2013)], we use the sum-over-state formula inherent to the second-order perturbation theory, composed of the contributions from the transitions within the ground state levels, from the transition between ground-state and excited state levels, and from a crossed term. These calculations involve a combination of experimental and quantum-chemical data for potential energy curves and transition dipole moments. We also investigate the case where the two molecules are in different vibrational levels and we show that the Moelwyn-Hughes approximation is valid provided that it is applied for each of the three contributions to the sum-over-state formula. Our results are particularly relevant in the context of inelastic and reactive collisions between ultracold bialkali molecules in deeply bound or in Feshbach levels.

26052576|t|The use of modern ultrasound tridimensional techniques for the evaluation of fetal cerebral midline structures- a practical approach.
26052576|a|Fetal central nervous system midline structures represent an essential landmark for the confirmation of normality or for the identification of severe pathology. The ultrasound examination of the fetal brain using modern 3D techniques allows the creation of high sensitivity reconstructions. The facility of 3D volume acquisition permits the identification of corpus callosum, median septum, cavum septi pellucid and cerebellar vermis even in difficult cases. The examination should rely on both static (3D) and dynamic acquisition (4D). The use of a practical ultrasound protocol in clinical settings ensures the visualization of the midline cerebral structures in the vast majorities of fetuses. In selected cases MRI can be performed.

26070235|t|Prehospital recognition of severe sepsis: development and validation of a novel emergency medical services screening tool.
26070235|a|OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate a predictive model and novel emergency medical services (EMS) screening tool for severe sepsis (SS). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A single EMS system and an urban, public hospital. PATIENTS: Sequential adult, nontrauma, nonarrest, at-risk, EMS-transported patients between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012 were included in the study. At-risk patients were defined as having all 3 of the following criteria present in the EMS setting: (1) heart rate greater than 90 beats/min, (2) respiratory rate greater than 20 beats/min, and (3) systolic blood pressure less than 110 mm Hg. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 66,439 EMS encounters, 555 met the criteria for analysis. Fourteen percent (n = 75) of patients had SS, of which 19% (n = 14) were identified by EMS clinical judgment. In-hospital mortality for patients with SS was 31% (n = 23). Six EMS characteristics were found to be predictors of SS: older age, transport from nursing home, Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD) 9-1-1 chief concern category of "sick person," hot tactile temperature assessment, low systolic blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation. The final predictive model showed good discrimination in derivation and validation subgroups (areas under curves, 0.843 and 0.820, respectively). Sensitivity of the final model was 91% in the derivation group and 78% in the validation group. At a predefined threshold of 2 or more points, prehospital severe sepsis (PRESS) score sensitivity was 86%. CONCLUSIONS: The PRESS score is a novel EMS screening tool for SS that demonstrates a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 47%. Additional validation is needed before this tool can be recommended for widespread clinical use.

26083513|t|Risk and protection factors for cardiovascular diseases among adults of Cuiab  , Mato Grosso, Brazil.
26083513|a|INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death and hospital expenses in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. OBJECTIVE: To describe the temporal variation on risk and protective factors for cardiovascular diseases in adults (>= 18 years old). METHODS: Data were obtained from population-based telephone surveys carried out between 2006 and 2009 in Cuiab  , the capital of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The prevalence of smoking, alcohol abuse, markers of diet quality consumption, physical activities, leisure, domestic work, and commute was estimated. Statistical significance of temporal variations in these estimators was estimated by logistic regression models, whose dependent variables were the analyzed risk factors (absent = 0; present = 1) and independent variable was the year of the survey. RESULTS: There was an increase in the proportion of men who reported to never have smoked (from 53 to 61%, p = 0.04). The frequency of regular soft drink consumption was reduced by 23% (p < 0.01). Overall, the reference to the consumption of fruits and vegetables increased by 19% (p = 0.02), and among men this increase was clearer (49%; p < 0.01). There was a reduction in domestic work (p < 0.01) and in leisure physical activity among women (from 14 to 10%; p = 0.02). Conversely, there was an increase in the proportion of women and individuals older than 40 years of age who make active commuting every day. CONCLUSION: Favorable changes in cardiovascular risk and protective factors were mostly observed among men, young adults, and those with more than eight schooling years.

26086708|t|Comparison of Land, Water, and Energy Requirements of Lettuce Grown Using Hydroponic vs. Conventional Agricultural Methods.
26086708|a|UNASSIGNED: The land, water, and energy requirements of hydroponics were compared to those of conventional agriculture by example of lettuce production in Yuma, Arizona, USA. Data were obtained from crop budgets and governmental agricultural statistics, and contrasted with theoretical data for hydroponic lettuce production derived by using engineering equations populated with literature values. Yields of lettuce per greenhouse unit (815 m2) of 41    6.1 kg/m2/y had water and energy demands of 20    3.8 L/kg/y and 90,000    11,000 kJ/kg/y (  standard deviation), respectively. In comparison, conventional production yielded 3.9    0.21 kg/m2/y of produce, with water and energy demands of 250    25 L/kg/y and 1100    75 kJ/kg/y, respectively. Hydroponics offered 11    1.7 times higher yields but required 82    11 times more energy compared to conventionally produced lettuce. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first quantitative comparison of conventional and hydroponic produce production by example of lettuce grown in the southwestern United States. It identified energy availability as a major factor in assessing the sustainability of hydroponics, and it points to water-scarce settings offering an abundance of renewable energy (e.g., from solar, geothermal, or wind power) as particularly attractive regions for hydroponic agriculture.

26085160|a|UNASSIGNED: The importance of neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) in protection against hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains controversial. We infused a chimpanzee with H06-immunoglobulin from a genotype 1a HCV-infected patient, and challenged with genotype strains efficiently neutralized by H06 in vitro. 1a-NtAb afforded no protection against 4a or 5a. Protection against homologous 1a lasted 18 weeks, but infection emerged when NtAb-titers waned. However, 6a-infection was prevented. The differential in vivo neutralization patterns have implications for HCV vaccine development.

26077337|t|Genetic evidence for common pathways in human age-related diseases.
26077337|a|UNASSIGNED: Aging is the single largest risk factor for chronic disease. Studies in model organisms have identified conserved pathways that modulate aging rate and the onset and progression of multiple age-related diseases, suggesting that common pathways of aging may influence age-related diseases in humans as well. To determine whether there is genetic evidence supporting the notion of common pathways underlying age-related diseases, we analyzed the genes and pathways found to be associated with five major categories of age-related disease using a total of 410 genomewide association studies (GWAS). While only a small number of genes are shared among all five disease categories, those found in at least three of the five major age-related disease categories are highly enriched for apoliprotein metabolism genes. We found that a more substantial number of gene ontology (GO) terms are shared among the 5 age-related disease categories and shared GO terms include canonical aging pathways identified in model organisms, such as nutrient-sensing signaling, translation, proteostasis, stress responses, and genome maintenance. Taking advantage of the vast amount of genetic data from the GWAS, our findings provide the first direct evidence that conserved pathways of aging simultaneously influence multiple age-related diseases in humans as has been demonstrated in model organisms.

26087195|t|DDX3 as a strongest prognosis marker and its downregulation promotes metastasis in colorectal cancer.
26087195|a|BACKGROUND: Conflicting results regarding the role of DEAD-box polypeptide 3 (DDX3) are seen not only between cancer types but also within the same type of cancer. In this study, we aimed at clarifying the prognostic significance of DDX3 in patients of major cancer types through large cohort survival analysis and further investigated its effects on cancer progression. METHODS: Large cohort survival analysis of 7 cancer types, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, glioblastoma, and ovarian cancer, was performed using public database at RNA level and was further confirmed by IHC analysis at protein level. Phenotype parameters of DDX3 knockdown colon cancer cells and the mechanism of DDX3 regulated cancer progression were investigated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In large cohort survival analysis, DDX3 had a significant prognostic predictive power in colorectal cancer at both RNA and protein level. Patients with low DDX3 expression had poor prognosis and frequent distant metastasis. Knockdown of DDX3 enhanced the migration and invasion abilities of colon cancer cells and promoted tumor metastasis in vivo. Snail upregulation with decreased membranous E-cadherin expression and reduced cell aggregation were found after DDX3 downregulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed the strong prognostic effect of DDX3 on colorectal cancer among seven major cancer types through larger cohort survival analysis at RNA and protein level. Low DDX3 expression promotes Snail/E-cadherin pathway mediated cancer metastasis and poor clinical outcome in colorectal cancer patients.

26086790|t|Representations of Value in the Brain: An Embarrassment of Riches?
26086790|a|UNASSIGNED: Over the past two decades, neuroscientists have increasingly turned their attention to the question of how the brain implements decisions between differently valued options. This emerging field, called neuroeconomics, has made quick progress in identifying a plethora of brain areas that track or are modulated by reward value. However, it is still unclear how and where in the brain value coding takes place. A primate study by Strait and colleagues in this issue of PLOS Biology finds overlapping signals of value coding in two brain regions central to the valuation process: the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum. This finding reconciles the primate and rodent literatures, provides valuable insight into the complexity of value computation, and helps set the agenda for future work in this area.

26088023|t|Achalasia Is Associated With eNOS4a4a, iNOS22GA, and nNOS29TT Genotypes: A Case-control Study.
26088023|a|Background/Aims: Achalasia is known to result from degeneration of inhibitory neurons, which are mostly nitrinergic. Characteristic features of achalasia include incomplete lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation and esophageal aperistalsis. Nitric oxide (NO), produced by NO synthase (NOS), plays an important role in peristalsis and LES relaxation. Therefore, we evaluated genetic polymorphisms of NOS gene isoforms (endothelial NOS [eNOS], inducible NOS [iNOS], and neuronal NOS [nNOS]) in patients with achalasia and healthy subjects (HS). Methods: Consecutive patients with achalasia (diagnosed using esophageal manometry) and HS were genotyped for 27-base pair (bp) eNOS variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), iNOS22G/A (rs1060826), nNOS C/T (rs2682826) polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), respectively. Results: Among 183 patients (118 [64.5%] male, age 39.5    13.0 years) with achalasia and 366 HS (254 [69.4%] male, age 40.8    11.0 years), eNOS4a4a genotype of 27-bp VNTR was more common among achalasia than HS (20 [10.9%] vs 13 [3.6%]; P < 0.001; OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.8-7.7). Patients with achalasia had iNOS22GA genotypes more often than HS (95 [51.9%] vs 93 [25.4%]; P < 0.001; OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.1-4.4). Frequency of genotypes GA + AA was higher in patients than HS (97 [53%] vs 107 [29.2%]; P < 0.001; OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.8-3.9). Also, nNOS29TT variant genotype in rs2682826 was commoner among patients compared to HS (14 [7.7%] vs 6 [1.6%]; P < 0.001; OR, 5.91; 95% CI, 2.2-15.8). Conclusions: Achalasia is associated with eNOS4a4a, iNOS22GA, and nNOS29TT genotypes. This may suggest that polymorphisms of eNOS, iNOS, and nNOS genes are risk factors for achalasia.

26091351|t|Understanding the gastrointestinal tract of the elderly to develop dietary solutions that prevent malnutrition.
26091351|a|UNASSIGNED: Although the prevalence of malnutrition in the old age is increasing worldwide a synthetic understanding of the impact of aging on the intake, digestion, and absorption of nutrients is still lacking. This review article aims at filling the gap in knowledge between the functional decline of the aging gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the consequences of malnutrition on the health status of elderly. Changes in the aging GIT include the mechanical disintegration of food, gastrointestinal motor function, food transit, chemical food digestion, and functionality of the intestinal wall. These alterations progressively decrease the ability of the GIT to provide the aging organism with adequate levels of nutrients, what contributes to the development of malnutrition. Malnutrition, in turn, increases the risks for the development of a range of pathologies associated with most organ systems, in particular the nervous-, muscoskeletal-, cardiovascular-, immune-, and skin systems. In addition to psychological, economics, and societal factors, dietary solutions preventing malnutrition should thus propose dietary guidelines and food products that integrate knowledge on the functionality of the aging GIT and the nutritional status of the elderly. Achieving this goal will request the identification, validation, and correlative analysis of biomarkers of food intake, nutrient bioavailability, and malnutrition.

26087986|a|BACKGROUND: Tanzania is on track to meet Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 for child survival, but is making insufficient progress for newborn survival and maternal health (MDG 5) and family planning. To understand this mixed progress and to identify priorities for the post-2015 era, Tanzania was selected as a Countdown to 2015 case study. METHODS: We analysed progress made in Tanzania between 1990 and 2014 in maternal, newborn, and child mortality, and unmet need for family planning, in which we used a health systems evaluation framework to assess coverage and equity of interventions along the continuum of care, health systems, policies and investments, while also considering contextual change (eg, economic and educational). We had five objectives, which assessed each level of the health systems evaluation framework. We used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) and did multiple linear regression analyses to explain the reduction in child mortality in Tanzania. We analysed the reasons for the slower changes in maternal and newborn survival and family planning, to inform priorities to end preventable maternal, newborn, and child deaths by 2030. FINDINGS: In the past two decades, Tanzania's population has doubled in size, necessitating a doubling of health and social services to maintain coverage. Total health-care financing also doubled, with donor funding for child health and HIV/AIDS more than tripling. Trends along the continuum of care varied, with preventive child health services reaching high coverage (>= 85%) and equity (socioeconomic status difference 13-14%), but lower coverage and wider inequities for child curative services (71% coverage, socioeconomic status difference 36%), facility delivery (52% coverage, socioeconomic status difference 56%), and family planning (46% coverage, socioeconomic status difference 22%). The LiST analysis suggested that around 39% of child mortality reduction was linked to increases in coverage of interventions, especially of immunisation and insecticide-treated bednets. Economic growth was also associated with reductions in child mortality. Child health programmes focused on selected high-impact interventions at lower levels of the health system (eg, the community and dispensary levels). Despite its high priority, implementation of maternal health care has been intermittent. Newborn survival has gained attention only since 2005, but high-impact interventions are already being implemented. Family planning had consistent policies but only recent reinvestment in implementation. INTERPRETATION: Mixed progress in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health in Tanzania indicates a complex interplay of political prioritisation, health financing, and consistent implementation. Post-2015 priorities for Tanzania should focus on the unmet need for family planning, especially in the Western and Lake regions; addressing gaps for coverage and quality of care at birth, especially in rural areas; and continuation of progress for child health.

26088216|t|Central and Peripheral Pain Generators in Women with Chronic Pelvic Pain: Patient Centered Assessment and Treatment.
26088216|a|UNASSIGNED: Women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP) often present without obvious cause on imaging studies, laboratory values or physical exam. Dysfunctional sensory processing in the central nervous system (CNS) may explain pain of unclear origin. Central sensitization (CS), a mechanism of centrally mediated pain, describes this abnormal processing of sensory information. Women with CPP often present with several seemingly unrelated symptoms. This can be explained by co-existing chronic pain syndromes occurring in the same patient. Central sensitization occurs in all of these pain syndromes, also described as dysfunctional pain syndromes, and thus may explain why several often occur in the same patient. Six of the most common pain disorders that co-exist in CPP include endometriosis, painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cysitis, vulvodynia, myofascial pain/ pelvic floor hypertonus, irritable bowel syndrome, and primary dysmenorrhea. Central pain generators, (pain originating from CS) and peripheral pain generators, (pain from local tissue damage,) can both occur in each of these six conditions. These pain generators will be described. Chronic pain, specifically dysfunctional sensory processing, is recognized as a systemic disease process like diabetes to be managed as opposed to a local problem to be "fixed" or cured. A multi-disciplinary approach to assessment and treatment with a focus on improving emotional, physical and social functioning instead of focusing strictly on pain reduction is more effective in decreasing disability. This is best achieved by determining the patient's needs and perspective through a patient-centered approach. Algorithms for such an approach to assessment and treatment are outlined.

26088366|t|Soft tissue sarcoma in France in 2014: Epidemiology, classification and organization of clinical care.
26088366|a|UNASSIGNED: Four thousand new cases of soft tissue sarcomas are diagnosed each year in France, 23% of which are localized in the abdomen and pelvis; the treatment of non-metastatic tumor is based on wide surgical resection, the quality of which determines the long-term outcome. To ensure appropriate care, the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommends that any patient with an unexplained soft tissue mass (of any size for deep lesions or of>5cm for superficial lesions) be referred to a specialized center with capacities for multidisciplinary team decision; appropriate imaging should be performed prior to treatment and a percutaneous image-guided needle biopsy should be routinely performed. In France, clinical and pathology networks (NetSarc and RRePS) currently offer patients a structured means to make a systematic diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma and help to provide access to appropriate treatment in a specialized center.

26089133|t|Intersubband Transition in GaN/InGaN Multiple Quantum Wells.
26089133|a|Utilizing the growth temperature controlled epitaxy, high quality GaN/In0.15Ga0.85N multiple quantum wells designed for intersubband transition (ISBT) as novel candidates in III-nitride infrared device applications have been experimentally realized for the first time. Photo-absorption originated from the ISBT has been successfully observed at infrared regime covering the 3-5    m atmosphere window, where the central absorption wavelength is modulated by adjusting the quantum well width. With increasing the quantum well thickness, the ISBT center wave length blue shifts at thickness less than 2.8   nm and then redshifts with further increase of the well thickness. The non-monotonic trend is most likely due to the polarization induced asymmetric shape of the quantum wells.

26091309|t|Operative delay to laparoscopic cholecystectomy: Racking up the cost of health care.
26091309|a|BACKGROUND: Health care providers are increasingly focused on cost containment. One potential target for cost containment is in-hospital management of acute cholecystitis. Ensuring cholecystectomy within 24 hours for cholecystitis could mitigate costs associated with longer hospitalizations. We sought to determine the cost consequences of delaying operative management. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2003-2011) was queried for adult patients (>= 16 years) who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for a primary diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Patients who underwent open procedures or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were excluded. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to analyze costs for each day's delay in surgery. Multivariable analyses adjusted for patient demographics, hospital descriptors, Charlson comorbidity index, mortality, and length of stay. RESULTS: We analyzed 191,032 records. Approximately 65% of the patients underwent surgery within 24 hours of admission. The average cost of care for surgery on the admission day was  11,087. Costs disproportionately increased by 22% on the second hospital day ( 13,526), by 37% on the third day ( 15,243), by 52% on the fourth day ( 16,822), by 64% on the fifth day ( 18,196), by 81% on the sixth day ( 20,125), and by 100% on the seventh day ( 22,250) when compared with the cost of care for procedures performed within 24 hours of admission. Subset analysis of patients discharged 24 hours or earlier from the time of surgery demonstrated similar trends. CONCLUSION: After controlling for patient- and hospital-related factors, we noted significant costs associated with each day's delay in operative management. Cost containment practices for acute cholecystitis justify consideration of same-day or next-day surgery where the diagnosis is straightforward. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and value-based analysis, level III.

26088908|t|Malnutrition is common in Ugandan children with cerebral palsy, particularly those over the age of five and those who had neonatal complications.
26088908|a|AIM: Poor growth and malnutrition are frequently reported in children with cerebral palsy in developed countries,but there is limited information from developing countries. We investigatedthe nutritional status of Ugandan children with cerebral palsy and described factors associated with poor nutrition. METHODS: We examined135 children from two to 12yearswith cerebral palsy,who attended Uganda's national referral hospital. A child was considered underweight, wasted, stunted or thin if the standard deviation scores for their weight for age, weight for height, height for age and body mass index for age were  <=-2.0 using World Health Organization growth standards. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with nutritional indicators. RESULTS: Over half (52%) of the children were malnourished, with underweight (42%) being the most common category, followed by stunting (38%), thinness (21%), and wasting (18%). Factors that were independently associated with being malnourished were: presence of cognitive impairment, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 4.5, being five years or older (aOR = 3.4) and feeding difficulties in the perinatal period (aOR = 3.2). CONCLUSION: Malnutrition was common in Ugandan children with cerebral palsy and more likely if they were fiveyears or more or had experienced neonatal complications.

26009879|t|Concurrent deletion of 16q23 and PTEN is an independent prognostic feature in prostate cancer.
26009879|a|UNASSIGNED: The deletion of 16q23-q24 belongs to the most frequent chromosomal changes in prostate cancer, but the clinical consequences of this alteration have not been studied in detail. We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using a 16q23 probe in more than 7,400 prostate cancers with clinical follow-up data assembled in a tissue microarray format. Chromosome 16q deletion was found in 21% of cancers, and was linked to advanced tumor stage, high Gleason grade, accelerated cell proliferation, the presence of lymph node metastases (p   <   0.0001 each) and positive surgical margin (p   =   0.0004). 16q Deletion was more frequent in ERG fusion-positive (27%) as compared to ERG fusion-negative cancers (16%, p   <   0.0001), and was linked to other ERG-associated deletions including phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (p   <   0.0001) and 3p13 (p   =   0.0303). In univariate analysis, the deletion of 16q was linked to early biochemical recurrence independently from the ERG status (p   <   0.0001). Tumors with codeletions of 16q and PTEN had a worse prognosis (p   =   0.0199) than those with PTEN or the deletion of 16q alone. Multivariate modeling revealed that the prognostic value of 16q/PTEN deletion patterns was independent from the established prognostic factors. In summary, the results of our study demonstrate that the deletion of 16q and PTEN cooperatively drives prostate cancer progression, and suggests that deletion analysis of 16q and PTEN could be of important clinical value particularly for preoperative risk assessment of the clinically most challenging group of low- and intermediated grade prostate cancers.

26049862|t|Invited Commentary: Clinical Utility of Prediction Models for Rare Outcomes-The Example of Pancreatic Cancer.
26049862|a|UNASSIGNED: Translating relative risk estimates into absolute risks is important in evaluating the potential clinical and public health relevance of etiologic discoveries. Predicting high absolute risk is challenging, particularly for rare endpoints such as pancreatic cancer. Recent efforts to develop risk prediction models for pancreatic cancer have found moderate risk levels for very small parts of the population. A new approach in which clinical symptoms and medication use are evaluated in addition to information on risk factors is presented by Risch et al. in this issue of the Journal (Am J Epidemiol. 2015;00(000):0000-0000). The authors estimated absolute risks based on the relative risks obtained from their case-control study. Their absolute risk estimates were higher than those from previous approaches but remained restricted to a very small proportion of the general population. In the present commentary, we address issues of absolute risk stratification (particularly for rare diseases), specific analytic methods, and how actionable information will differ based on the disease and possible intervention. We suggest that moving from cancer-specific models to broader models used to predict risk for multiple outcomes can make risk prediction for rare diseases more effective. When considering translational goals, it is important to estimate absolute risk at the early stages of etiologic research. The results can be sobering but allow focusing on the most promising goals.

26004493|t|Mechanisms and therapeutic potential of microRNAs in hypertension.
26004493|a|UNASSIGNED: Hypertension is the major risk factor for the development of stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure and renal disease. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of hypertension are complex and remain largely elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding RNA fragments of 22-26 nucleotides and regulate protein expression post-transcriptionally by targeting the 3'-untranslated region of mRNA. A growing body of recent research indicates that miRNAs are important in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension. Herein, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of miRNAs in cardiovascular remodeling, focusing specifically on hypertension. We also review recent progress of the miRNA-based therapeutics including pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies (such as exercise training) and their potential applications in the management of hypertension.

26040635|t|Long-term effect of a short interprofessional education interaction between medical and physical therapy students.
26040635|a|UNASSIGNED: Medicine is increasingly focused on team-based practice as interprofessional cooperation leads to better patient care. Thus, it is necessary to teach teamwork and collaboration with other health care professionals in undergraduate medical education to ensure that trainees entering the workforce are prepared to work in teams. Gross anatomy provides an opportunity to expose students to interprofessional education (IPE) early in their training. The purpose of this study is to describe an IPE experience and report if the experience has lasting influence on the participating students. The Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) questionnaire was administered to first year medical (MD) and physical therapy (PT) students at Mayo Medical School and Mayo School of Health Sciences. Results demonstrated an openness on the part of the students to IPE. Interprofessional education experiences were incorporated into gross anatomy courses in both medical and PT curricula. The IPE experiences included a social event, peer-teaching, and collaborative clinical problem-solving sessions. These sessions enhanced gross anatomy education by reinforcing previous material and providing the opportunity to work on clinical cases from the perspective of two healthcare disciplines. After course completion, students again completed the RIPLS. Finally, one year after course completion, students were asked to provide feedback on their experience. The post-curricular RIPLS, similar to the pre-curricular RIPLS, illustrated openness to IPE from both MD and PT students. There were however, significant differences in MD and PT perceptions of roles and responsibilities. One-year follow-up indicated long-term retention of lessons learned during IPE.

26043043|t|Stable Odor Recognition by a neuro-adaptive Electronic Nose.
26043043|a|UNASSIGNED: Sensitivity, selectivity and stability are decisive properties of sensors. In chemical gas sensors odor recognition can be severely compromised by poor signal stability, particularly in real life applications where the sensors are exposed to unpredictable sequences of odors under changing external conditions. Although olfactory receptor neurons in the nose face similar stimulus sequences under likewise changing conditions, odor recognition is very stable and odorants can be reliably identified independently from past odor perception. We postulate that appropriate pre-processing of the output signals of chemical sensors substantially contributes to the stability of odor recognition, in spite of marked sensor instabilities. To investigate this hypothesis, we use an adaptive, unsupervised neural network inspired by the glomerular input circuitry of the olfactory bulb. Essentially the model reduces the effect of the sensors' instabilities by utilizing them via an adaptive multicompartment feed-forward inhibition. We collected and analyzed responses of a 4   *   4 gas sensor array to a number of volatile compounds applied over a period of 18 months, whereby every sensor was sampled episodically. The network conferred excellent stability to the compounds' identification and was clearly superior over standard classifiers, even when one of the sensors exhibited random fluctuations or stopped working at all.

26031542|t|Reduced Sexual Risk Behaviors Among Young Men of Color Who Have Sex with Men: Findings from the Community-Based Organization Behavioral Outcomes of Many Men, Many Voices (CBOP-3MV) Project.
26031542|a|UNASSIGNED: In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funded community-based organizations (CBOs) to deliver Many Men, Many Voices (3MV) to young men of color who have sex with men. Although 3MV, a group-level behavioral intervention designed to reduce human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors of black men who have sex with men (MSM), has shown effectiveness when delivered in a controlled research environment, there is limited evidence that the intervention is associated with similar outcomes in "real world" settings. For the current project, CDC funded three CBOs to conduct outcome monitoring of the 3MV intervention to determine if young MSM of color report changes in HIV risk behaviors postintervention. Using a repeated measures design, risk behaviors were collected at baseline and again at 3 and 6  months postintervention. Changes in risk behaviors were assessed using generalized estimating equations. Participants (n   =   337) reported decreases in sexual risk behaviors at both follow-up time points, such as sex without a condom, sex without a condom and multiple partners, and sex without a condom with serodiscordant or status unknown partners. Results suggest that 3MV may be an effective tool for reducing HIV risk behaviors in this critical target population.

26033292|t|Contribution of water chemistry and fish condition to otolith chemistry: comparisons across salinity environments.
26033292|a|This study quantified the per cent contribution of water chemistry to otolith chemistry using enriched stable isotopes of strontium ((86) Sr) and barium ((137) Ba). Euryhaline barramundi Lates calcarifer, were reared in marine (salinity 40), estuarine (salinity 20) and freshwater (salinity 0) under different temperature treatments. To calculate the contribution of water to Sr and Ba in otoliths, enriched isotopes in the tank water and otoliths were quantified and fitted to isotope mixing models. Fulton's K and RNA:DNA were also measured to explore the influence of fish condition on sources of element uptake. Water was the predominant source of otolith Sr (between 65 and 99%) and Ba (between 64 and 89%) in all treatments, but contributions varied with temperature (for Ba), or interactively with temperature and salinity (for Sr). Fish condition indices were affected independently by the experimental rearing conditions, as RNA:DNA differed significantly among salinity treatments and Fulton's K was significantly different between temperature treatments. Regression analyses did not detect relations between fish condition and per cent contribution values. General linear models indicated that contributions from water chemistry to otolith chemistry were primarily influenced by temperature and secondly by fish condition, with a relatively minor influence of salinity. These results further the understanding of factors that affect otolith element uptake, highlighting the necessity to consider the influence of environment and fish condition when interpreting otolith element data to reconstruct the environmental histories of fish.

26024077|t|The Changing Profile of Astigmatism in Childhood: The NICER Study.
26024077|a|PURPOSE: We performed a prospective study of the changing profile of astigmatism in white school children in Northern Ireland. METHODS: Of the 399 6- to 7-year-old and 669 12- to 13-year-old participants in Phase 1 of the Northern Ireland Childhood Errors of Refraction (NICER) study, 302 (76%) of the younger and 436 (65%) of the older cohort were re-examined three years later (Phase 2). Stratified random cluster sampling was used. Following cycloplegia (cyclopentolate HCl 1%) refractive error was recorded by the Shin-Nippon-SRW-5000 autorefractor. Astigmatism is defined as >= 1.00 diopters cylinder (DC). Right eye data only are presented. RESULTS: The prevalence of astigmatism was unchanged in both cohorts: younger cohort 17.1% (95% confidence intervals [CIs], 13.3-21.6) were astigmatic at 9 to 10 years compared to 22.9% (95% CIs, 18.3-28.2) at 6 to 7 years; older cohort, 17.5% (95% CIs, 13.9-21.7) of participants were astigmatic at 15-16 years compared to 18.4% (95% CIs, 13.4-24.8) at age 12 to 13 years. Although prevalence remained unchanged, it was not necessarily the same children who had astigmatism at both phases. Some lost astigmatism (10.0%; CIs, 7.5-13.3 younger cohort and 17.4%; CIs, 13.5-22.2 older cohort); others became astigmatic (9.1%; CIs, 6.7-12.2 younger cohort and 11.6%; CIs, 8.4-15.8 older cohort). CONCLUSIONS: This study presents novel data demonstrating that the astigmatic error of white children does not remain stable throughout childhood. Although prevalence of astigmatism is unchanged between ages 6 and 7 to 15 to 16 years; during this time period individual children are developing astigmatism while other children become nonastigmatic. It is difficult to predict from their refractive data who will demonstrate these changes, highlighting the importance of all children having regular eye examinations to ensure that their visual requirements are met.

26023974|t|Phosphorus Losses from an Irrigated Watershed in the Northwestern United States: Case Study of the Upper Snake Rock Watershed.
26023974|a|UNASSIGNED: Watersheds using surface water for irrigation often return a portion of the water to a water body. This irrigation return flow often includes sediment and nutrients that reduce the quality of the receiving water body. Research in the 82,000-ha Upper Snake Rock (USR) watershed from 2005 to 2008 showed that, on average, water diverted from the Snake River annually supplied 547 kg ha of total suspended solids (TSS), 1.1 kg ha of total P (TP), and 0.50 kg ha of dissolved P (DP) to the irrigation tract. Irrigation return flow from the USR watershed contributed 414 kg ha of TSS, 0.71 kg ha of TP, and 0.32 kg ha of DP back to the Snake River. Significantly more TP flowed into the watershed than returned to the Snake River, whereas there was no significant difference between inflow and return flow loads for TSS and DP. Average TSS and TP concentrations in return flow were 71 and 0.12 mg L, respectively, which exceeded the TMDL limits of 52 mg L TSS and 0.075 mg L TP set for this section of the Snake River. Monitoring inflow and outflow for five water quality ponds constructed to reduce sediment and P losses from the watershed showed that TSS concentrations were reduced 36 to 75%, but DP concentrations were reduced only 7 to 16%. This research showed that continued implementation of conservation practices should result in irrigation return flow from the USR watershed meeting the total maximum daily load limits for the Snake River.

26036614|t|Ethylene Biosynthesis is Promoted by Very-Long-Chain Fatty Acids during Lysigenous Aerenchyma Formation in Rice Roots.
26036614|a|UNASSIGNED: In rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots, lysigenous aerenchyma, which is created by programmed cell death and lysis of cortical cells, is constitutively formed under aerobic conditions, and its formation is further induced under oxygen-deficient conditions. Ethylene is involved in the induction of aerenchyma formation. reduced culm number 1 (rcn1) is a rice mutant in which the gene encoding the ATP-binding cassette transporter RCN1/OsABCG5 is defective. Here, we report that the induction of aerenchyma formation was reduced in roots of rcn1 grown in stagnant deoxygenated nutrient solution (i.e., under stagnant conditions, which mimic oxygen-deficient conditions in waterlogged soils). 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) is a key enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis. Stagnant conditions hardly induced the expression of ACS1 in rcn1 roots, resulting in low ethylene production in the roots. Accumulation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) of 24, 26 and 28 carbons was reduced in rcn1 roots. Exogenously supplied VLCFA (26 carbons) increased the expression level of ACS1, and induced aerenchyma formation in rcn1 roots. Moreover, in rice lines in which the gene encoding a fatty acid elongase (CUT1L) was silenced, both ACS1 expression and aerenchyma formation were reduced. Interestingly, the expression of ACS1, CUT1L and RCN1/OsABCG5 was induced predominantly in the outer part of roots (OPR) under stagnant conditions. These results suggest that, in rice under oxygen-deficient conditions, VLCFAs increase ethylene production by promoting ACC biosynthesis in the OPR, which, in turn, induces aerenchyma formation in the root cortex.

26039107|t|F-18-FDG PET-CT in children and young adults with Ewing sarcoma diagnosed in Norway during 2005-2012: a national population-based study.
26039107|a|BACKGROUND: To examine national imaging strategies regarding the use of F-18-FDG PET-CT in patients with Ewing sarcoma and study factors that might influence the use of PET-CT, such as tumour biology (Picci grade of operation specimen), clinical disease stage and age. METHODS: We examined the medical records including pathology and imaging of all patients below 30  years diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma in Norway in 2005-2012. RESULTS: Of 61 patients treated at one of the two national sarcoma treatment service centres (Oslo: 35, Bergen: 26), 29 patients had localized disease, 8 had tumour extending to organs nearby and 24 had metastases. Among 35 operated patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 15 had Picci grades II and III (good responders) and 20 grade I (poor responders). We found a significant difference in the use of PET-CT (Oslo/Bergen 0  9 versus 2  0 scans per patient, P  =  0  010) and in the use of MRI (Oslo/Bergen: eight versus 13, P  =  0  006). No differences were proven for ultrasound, radiography, CT or skeletal scintigraphy. The number of PET-CTs was associated with clinical disease stage at diagnosis (P  =  0  041) but not with Picci grade or age. The number of PET studies was not correlated to the number of MR studies. CONCLUSIONS: The use of PET-CT in children and young adults diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma in Norway during 2005-2012 at the two national sarcoma treatment service centres differed significantly. The use of PET-CT imaging was related to the clinical disease stage at diagnosis but unrelated to patient age and tumour biology (Picci grade).

26003829|t|Etiology of phantom limb syndrome: Insights from a 3D default space consciousness model.
26003829|a|UNASSIGNED: In this article, we examine phantom limb syndrome to gain insights into how the brain functions as the mind and how consciousness arises. We further explore our previously proposed consciousness model in which consciousness and body schema arise when information from throughout the body is processed by corticothalamic feedback loops and integrated by the thalamus. The parietal lobe spatially maps visual and non-visual information and the thalamus integrates and recreates this processed sensory information within a three-dimensional space termed the "3D default space." We propose that phantom limb syndrome and phantom limb pain arise when the afferent signaling from the amputated limb is lost but the neural circuits remain intact. In addition, integration of conflicting sensory information within the default 3D space and the loss of inhibitory afferent feedback to efferent motor activity from the amputated limb may underlie phantom limb pain.

26002148|t|Efficient and rapid adsorption characteristics of templating modified guar gum and silica nanocomposite toward removal of toxic reactive blue and Congo red dyes.
26002148|a|UNASSIGNED: The present study highlights the potentiality of sol-gel synthesized guar gum-graft-poly (acrylamide)/silica (g-GG/SiO2) hybrid nanocomposite toward the rapid removal of toxic reactive blue 4 (RB) and Congo red (CR) dyes from aqueous solution. Various physicochemical characterizations support the feasibility of the functionalized guar gum matrix as efficient template for the formation of homogeneous nanoscale silica particles. The composite demonstrates rapid and superior adsorption efficiency of RB (Qmax: 579.01mgg(-1) within 40min) and CR (Qmax: 233.24mgg(-1) within 30min) dyes from aqueous environment. Here, the pH driven adsorption process depends strongly on the ionic strength of the salt solution. The adsorption kinetics data predicts that pseudo second-order (surface adsorption) and intraparticle diffusion take place simultaneously. The adsorption equilibrium is in good agreement with the Langmuir isotherm, while the thermodynamics study confirms spontaneous nature of the adsorption process. Desorption study predicts the excellent regenerative efficacy of nanocomposite.

26018404|t|The Histological Components of the Phoniatrical Body-Cover Model in Minipigs of Different Ages.
26018404|a|UNASSIGNED: Pigs are models in human phoniatry. However, features of maturation and ageing have not been considered with regard to the so-called body-cover model in this species. Therefore, the glottis of "young" (2-3 months; n = 6) and "old" (4-7 years; n = 6) minipigs was investigated. Their cranial (CraF) and caudal (CauF) vocal folds were histomorphometrically and stratigraphically analysed with emphasis on their amounts of collagen structures and elastic fibres. A dense subepithelial layer (SEL) was a distinct feature of CraF and CauF of both age groups; it was spread upon the underlying loose, flexible "cover" like a fibro-elastic membrane. The "cover" was characterised by the so-called superficial layer (SL), which was distinctly loose in the "young" minipigs, but had a much denser texture in the "old" minipigs. Here, the SL was dominated by elastic fibres in the CraF, but was of mixed qualities (collagenous and elastic) in the CauF. The structural requirements for the SL's function as a loose "cover" were thus met only in the "young" animals. A clearly demarcated intermediate layer (IL)-characterised by high amounts of elastic fibres (as in humans)-was only found in the CraF of the "young" animals. In the "old" animals, it had lost its demarcation. In the depth of the CraF of the "old" animals, many thick collagen fibre bundles were detected in a location equivalent to that of the vocal muscle in the CauF. The development of their large diameters was interpreted as part of the maturation process, thereby supporting the hypothesis of their functional importance as a component of the "body." In the CauF, the amounts of collagen structures increased throughout the entire lamina propria, resulting in a loss of demarcated stratigraphical subdivisions in the "old" minipigs. This situation resembled that described in the vocal fold of geriatric humans.

26020491|t|Examination of metabolic responses to phosphorus limitation via proteomic analyses in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum.
26020491|a|UNASSIGNED: Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for the survival of marine phytoplankton. In the present study, phytoplankton response to phosphorus limitation was studied by proteomic profiling in diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum in both cellular and molecular levels. A total of 42 non-redundant proteins were identified, among which 8 proteins were found to be upregulated and 34 proteins were downregulated. The results also showed that the proteins associated with inorganic phosphate uptake were downregulated, whereas the proteins involved in organic phosphorus uptake such as alkaline phosphatase were upregulated. The proteins involved in metabolic responses such as protein degradation, lipid accumulation and photorespiration were upregulated whereas energy metabolism, photosynthesis, amino acid and nucleic acid metabolism tend to be downregulated. Overall our results showed the changes in protein levels of P. tricornutum during phosphorus stress. This study preludes for understanding the role of phosphorous in marine biogeochemical cycles and phytoplankton response to phosphorous scarcity in ocean. It also provides insight into the succession of phytoplankton community, providing scientific basis for elucidating the mechanism of algal blooms.

26019025|t|Functional Assessment in Tibial Hemimelia (Can We Also Save the Foot in Reconstruction?).
26019025|a|BACKGROUND: The congenital absence of the tibia is a rare disease, and an orthopaedic surgeon may not encounter such cases during the course of his/her career. This is the largest report to date of the management of such cases by a single surgeon. The foot and leg were persevered in the majority of the cases, and a functional evaluation system was used to report outcomes. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with tibial hemimelia, who had been under the direct care of the authors since infancy, were evaluated clinically and radiographically. The patients or their parents filled out the Pediatric Quality of Life and the parents' satisfaction forms. The surgical interventions performed, and their effects on school attendance and, and also the shoe type they wore were documented. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (19 girls and 17 boys) with 48 tibial-deficient limbs (19 right, 5 left, and 12 both right and left sides) were studied. The patients were assessed at 12 years (2.5 to 32.5 y), with a mean follow-up of 9 years (2 to 23 y). The 48 limbs included 14 type I, 16 type II, 11 type IV, and 7 unclassified by using the Jones classification; and 6 type I, 11 type II, 16 type III, 1 type IV, and 14 type VII by using the Weber classification. Primary amputation was performed in 8 patients (10 limbs) and limb preservation surgeries on 38 legs (28 patients). Tibiofibular synostosis, centralization of the ankle, and Ilizarov lengthening were the most common procedures. Nonunion of tibiofibular synostosis (2 cases) and knee stiffness (6 cases) were the main complications. Among the reconstructed limbs, 12 were in regular and 18 in modified shoes. The Pediatric Quality of Life of 68 points in the reconstructed group was a significant achievement, and it was also better than the score of patients who had undergone amputation. CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of tibial hemimelia with foot preservation provides good functional outcome in the majority of cases. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.

26020839|t|Arginine methylation of hnRNPUL1 regulates interaction with NBS1 and recruitment to sites of DNA damage.
26020839|a|UNASSIGNED: Arginine methylation is a post-translational modification required for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Cells deficient in protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) have DNA damage signaling defects, defective checkpoint activation and extensive genomic instability. Herein we identify the DNA damage protein and RNA binding protein, hnRNPUL1, to be a substrate of PRMT1. We identify the dimethylation of R584, R618, R620, R645, and R656, as well as the monomethylation of R661 R685 and R690 within hnRNPUL1 in U2OS cells by mass spectrometry. Moreover, we define the arginines within the RGG/RG motifs as the site of methylation by PRMT1 both in vitro and in vivo. The arginines 612, 618, 620, 639, 645, 656 and 661 within the human hnRNPUL1 RGG/RG motifs were substituted with lysines to generate hnRNPUL1(RK). hnRNPUL1(RK) was hypomethylated and lacked the ability to interact with PRMT1, unlike wild type hnRNPUL1. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that hnRNPUL1(RK) had impaired ability to associate with the DNA damage protein NBS1. Moreover, hnRNPUL1(RK) was not recruited to sites of DNA damage, unlike wild type hnRNPUL1, in the presence of transcriptional inhibitors. These findings define a role for arginine methylation during the DNA damage response to regulate protein-protein interactions for the recruitment at sites of damage.

26112774|t|Beyond positivism: Understanding and addressing childhood obesity disparities through a Critical Theory perspective.
26112774|a|PURPOSE: We apply Critical Theory to examine menu labeling with the aim of uncovering important implications for nursing practice, research, and policy. CONCLUSIONS: Our critical analysis uncovers barriers to menu labeling's effectiveness, particularly for vulnerable populations. Nurses must work to minimize the impact of these barriers and optimize the effectiveness of menu labeling, in order to strengthen the fight against obesity. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: We suggest changes, guided by this critical analysis, which can be implemented by nurses working in clinical practice, research, and policy.

26004763|t|Selective Activation of a Putative Reinforcement Signal Conditions Cued Interval Timing in Primary Visual Cortex.
26004763|a|UNASSIGNED: As a consequence of conditioning visual cues with delayed reward, cue-evoked neural activity that predicts the time of expected future reward emerges in the primary visual cortex (V1). We hypothesized that this reward-timing activity is engendered by a reinforcement signal conveying reward acquisition to V1. In lieu of behavioral conditioning, we assessed in  vivo whether selective activation of either basal forebrain (BF) or cholinergic innervation is sufficient to condition cued interval-timing activity. Substituting for actual reward, optogenetic activation of BF or cholinergic input within V1 at fixed delays following visual stimulation entrains neural responses that mimic behaviorally conditioned reward-timing activity. Optogenetically conditioned neural responses express cue-evoked temporal intervals that correspond to the conditioning intervals, are bidirectionally modifiable, display experience-dependent refinement, and exhibit a scale invariance to the  encoded delay. Our results demonstrate that the  activation of BF or cholinergic input within V1 is sufficient to encode cued interval-timing activity and indicate that V1 itself is a substrate for associative learning that may inform the timing of visually cued behaviors.

26046253|t|Temporal relationships between adipocytokines and diabetes risk in Hispanic adolescents with obesity.
26046253|a|OBJECTIVE: Circulating cytokines are frequently cited as contributors to insulin resistance in children with obesity. This study examined whether circulating adipocytokines, independent of adiposity, predicted pubertal changes in insulin sensitivity (SI), insulin secretion (AIR), and b-cell function in high-risk adolescents. METHODS: 158 Hispanic adolescents with overweight or obesity were followed for a median of 4 years. Adipocytokines were measured using Luminex technology. SI, AIR, and the disposition index were derived from an intravenous glucose tolerance test and minimal modeling. Total fat mass was measured by DXA and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) by MRI. RESULTS: Surprisingly, mean IL-8, IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a decreased between 5% and 6.5% per year from baseline (P   <   0.001). Despite the general temporal trends, gaining 1-SD of VAT was associated with a 2% and 5% increase in MCP-1 and IL-8 (P   <   0.05). In addition, a 1-SD higher MCP-1 or IL-6 concentration at baseline was associated with a 16% and 21% greater decline in SI during puberty vs. prepuberty (P   <   0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Several adipocytokines decreased during adolescence and were weakly associated with VAT and lower SI during puberty. Circulating adipocytokines have relatively limited associations with pubertal changes in diabetes risk; however, the consistent findings with MCP-1 warrant further investigation.

26006252|t|Sequential and Simultaneous Applications of UV and Chlorine for Adenovirus Inactivation.
26006252|a|UNASSIGNED: Adenoviruses are water-borne human pathogens with high resistance to UV disinfection. Combination of UV treatment and chlorination could be an effective approach to deal with adenoviruses. In this study, human adenovirus 5 (HAdV-5) was challenged in a bench-scale experiment by separate applications of UV or chlorine and by combined applications of UV and chlorine in either a sequential or simultaneous manner. The treated samples were then propagated in human lung carcinoma epithelial cells to quantify the log inactivation of HAdV-5. When the processes were separate, a fluence of 100  mJ/cm(2) and a CT value of 0.02  mg  min/L were required to achieve 2 log inactivation of HAdV-5 by UV disinfection and chlorination, respectively. Interestingly, synergistic effects on the HAdV-5 inactivation rates were found in the sequential process of chlorine followed by UV (Cl2-UV) (p  <  0.05, ANCOVA) in comparison to the separate processes or the simultaneous application of UV/Cl2. This implies that a pretreatment with chlorine may increase the sensitivity of the virus to the subsequent UV disinfection. In conclusion, this study suggests that the combined application of UV and chlorine could be an effective measure against adenoviruses as a multi-barrier approach in water disinfection.

26015487|t|Access to psychiatrists by French-speaking patients in Ontario hospitals: 2005 to 2013.
26015487|a|UNASSIGNED: There has been a limited amount of research suggesting that cultural and linguistic variables may affect access to health services, but no study has examined the access of French-speaking Canadians to psychiatrists. The present study used data from the Ontario Mental Health Reporting System to examine patterns of daily contact with psychiatrists in the first 3 days of admission to mental health facilities in Ontario. The results showed that after controlling for a broad range of covariates, French-speaking Ontarians were about one-third as likely to have daily contact with psychiatrists in that time period compared to English-speaking patients. These results were not explained by regional differences. Instead, they point to the possibility that language poses an important barrier to specific and highly specialized mental health services in this province.

26014757|t|When Competing Viruses Unify: Evolution, Conservation, and Plasticity of Genetic Identities.
26014757|a|UNASSIGNED: In the early 1970s, Manfred Eigen and colleagues developed the quasispecies model (qs) for the population-based origin of RNAs representing the early genetic code. The Eigen idea is basically that a halo of mutants is generated by error-prone replication around the master fittest type which will behave similarly as a biological population. But almost from the start, very interesting and unexpected observations were made regarding competition versus co-operation which suggested more complex interactions. It thus became increasingly clear that although viruses functioned similar to biological species, their behavior was much more complex than the original theory could explain, especially adaptation without changing the consensus involving minority populations. With respect to the origin of natural codes, meaning, and code-use in interactions (communication), it also became clear that individual fittest type-based mechanisms were likewise unable to explain the origin of natural codes such as the genetic code with their context- and consortia-dependence (pragmatic nature). This, instead, required the participation of groups of agents competent in the code and able to edit code because natural codes do not code themselves. Three lines of inquiry, experimental virology, quasispecies theory, and the study of natural codes converged to indicate that consortia of co-operative RNA agents such as viruses must be involved in the fitness of RNA and its involvement in communication, i.e., code-competent interactions. We called this co-operative form quasispecies consortia (qs-c). They are the essential agents that constitute the possibility of evolution of biological group identity. Finally, the basic interactional motifs for the emergence of group identity, communication, and co-operation-together with its opposing functions-are explained by the "Gangen" hypothesis.

26095249|t|Prenatal exposure to phthalates and neuropsychological development during childhood.
26095249|a|UNASSIGNED: There is inconsistent evidence regarding the effects of prenatal phthalate exposure on children's neuropsychological development. We evaluate the association between prenatal phthalate exposure and the cognitive, psychomotor and behavioral development of 367 children at repeated ages in a prospective birth cohort study. We measured phthalate metabolites (sum of four DEHP metabolites -   4DEHP, MBzP, MEP, MiBP and MnBP) in urine samples collected during the 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy in women participating in the INMA-Sabadell birth cohort study. We assessed cognitive and psychomotor development of their children at 1 and 4 years, and social competence, ADHD symptoms and other behavioral problems at 4 and 7 years. No associations were observed between prenatal phthalate exposure and cognitive and psychomotor scores at the age of 1 year and at the age of 4 years, except for an association between MBzP and lower psychomotor scores (b=-1.49 [95% confidence interval (CI)=-2.78, -0.21]).   4DEHP concentrations were associated with increased social competence scores at 4 years and with reduced ADHD symptoms at age 4 and 7 years. Increasing MEP concentrations were associated with a reduced risk of inattention symptoms at 4 years. No associations were observed for MBzP, MiBP or MnBP in relation to behavioral problems. This study, with multiple phthalate exposure measurements and measures of neuropsychological domains at different ages, suggest that prenatal phthalate exposure does not adversely affect children's cognitive, psychomotor or behavioral development.

26097829|t|Intraparotid schwannoma: A rare case report.
26097829|a|UNASSIGNED: Pleomorphic adenomas are the most common tumors which present as parotid masses. Shwannoma (peripheral nerve sheath tumor) is a rare entity in this region. Very few schwannomas originate from the facial nerve and in the majority of these cases the tumor involves its intratemporal part. The following case is reported because it presented as an asymptomatic parotid swelling with normal seventh nerve function, which masqueraded as pleomorphic adenoma clinically, radiologically and cytologically. However, it turned out to be peripheral nerve sheath tumor on histopathological examination.

26098458|t|Prostate Cancer: Interobserver Agreement and Accuracy with the Revised Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System at Multiparametric MR Imaging.
26098458|a|UNASSIGNED: Purpose To evaluate accuracy and interobserver variability with the use of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2.0 for detection of prostate cancer at multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in a biopsy-na  ve patient population. Materials and Methods This retrospective HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients for use of their imaging and histopathologic data in future research studies. In 101 biopsy-na  ve patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels who underwent multiparametric MR imaging of the prostate and subsequent transrectal ultrasonography (US)-MR imaging fusion-guided biopsy, suspicious lesions detected at multiparametric MR imaging were scored by five readers who were blinded to pathologic results by using to the newly revised PI-RADS and the scoring system developed in-house. Interobserver agreement was evaluated by using k statistics, and the correlation of pathologic results with each of the two scoring systems was evaluated by using the Kendall    correlation coefficient. Results Specimens of 162 lesions in 94 patients were sampled by means of transrectal US-MR imaging fusion biopsy. Results for 87 (54%) lesions were positive for prostate cancer. Kendall    values with the PI-RADS and the in-house-developed scoring system, respectively, at T2-weighted MR imaging in the peripheral zone were 0.51 and 0.17 and in the transitional zone, 0.45 and -0.11; at diffusion-weighted MR imaging, 0.42 and 0.28; at dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR imaging, 0.23 and 0.24, and overall suspicion scores were 0.42 and 0.49. Median k scores among all possible pairs of readers for PI-RADS and the in-house-developed scoring system, respectively, for T2-weighted MR images in the peripheral zone were 0.47 and 0.15; transitional zone, 0.37 and 0.07; diffusion-weighted MR imaging, 0.41 and 0.57; dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging, 0.48 and 0.41; and overall suspicion scores, 0.46 and 0.55. Conclusion Use of the revised PI-RADS provides moderately reproducible MR imaging scores for detection of clinically relevant disease.

26071089|t|Accelerometric signals in automatic balance assessment.
26071089|a|UNASSIGNED: The paper presents the automatic computer-aided balance assessment system for supporting and monitoring the diagnosis and rehabilitation process of patients with limited mobility or disabled in home environment. The system has adopted seven Berg Balance Scale activities. The assessment approach is based on the accelerometric signals acquired by the inertial sensors worn by the patient. Several specific, mostly medium frequency features of signals are introduced and discussed. The reduction of the feature vector has been performed using the multilevel Fisher's linear discriminant. The classification employs the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network. The direct assessment effectiveness ranges from 75% to 94% for various activities.

26065652|t|Mapping the interaction between factor VIII and von Willebrand factor by electron microscopy and mass spectrometry.
26065652|a|UNASSIGNED: Association with the D'D3 domain of von Willebrand factor (VWF) stabilizes factor VIII (FVIII) in the circulation and maintains it at a level sufficient to prevent spontaneous bleeding. We employed negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) to visualize complexes of FVIII with dimeric and monomeric forms of the D'D3 domain. The EM averages show that FVIII interacts with the D'D3 domain primarily through its C1 domain, with the C2 domain providing a secondary attachment site. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry corroborated the importance of the C1 domain in D'D3 binding and implicates additional surface regions on FVIII in the interaction. Together, our results establish that the C1 domain is the major binding site on FVIII for VWF, reiterate the importance of the a3 acidic peptide in VWF binding, and suggest that the A3 and C2 domains play ancillary roles in this interaction.

26001240|t|Septic Arthritis in Children: Frequency of Coexisting Unsuspected Osteomyelitis and Implications on Imaging Work-Up and Management.
26001240|a|OBJECTIVE: Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis clinically present at any age with overlapping signs and symptoms. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the demographic distribution of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis in children and to explore optimal imaging guidelines for these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of children up to 18 years old who were treated for osteomyelitis or septic arthritis between January 2011 and September 2013. All patients underwent MRI without previous intervention. Studies were reviewed to determine the incidence of septic arthritis or superimposed osteomyelitis. The reference diagnosis was based on the combined review by the orthopedic surgeon and infectious disease notes, discharge summary, operative report, and MRI examination. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two children who underwent 177 MRI examinations were diagnosed with acute musculoskeletal infection. One hundred three patients were included in the septic arthritis category, of whom 70 (68%) had septic arthritis with osteomyelitis. Seventy-four (42.1%) patients had isolated osteomyelitis without septic arthritis. Children under 2 years old were more likely to have septic arthritis (either isolated or with osteomyelitis) than isolated osteomyelitis compared with older children (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: In children who underwent MRI for suspected musculoskeletal infection, septic arthritis was more prevalent in children under the age of 2 years than in older children. However, both septic arthritis and osteomyelitis were found frequently in older children. Musculoskeletal infection imaging workup guidelines for children of all ages should address the frequent association of osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. We recommend that MRI should be used in the evaluation of suspected musculoskeletal infections in children, and the nearest joint should always be included to evaluate the extent of articular disease.

26009756|t|Response of layer and broiler strain chickens to parenteral administration of a live Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine.
26009756|a|UNASSIGNED: Responses to the parenteral administration of a live aroA deletion Salmonella serovar Typhimurium vaccine given to three brown egg layer strains and two broiler strains were studied. Twenty-five birds of each strain were reared together in floor pens to 6 weeks of age and then moved as individual strains to new floor pens and injected with 10(8) colony forming units (CFU) per bird of the vaccine bacteria intramuscularly or subcutaneously, 10(6) CFU per bird subcutaneously, or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) subcutaneously as a vaccination control. Three birds of one layer strain were injected intramuscularly with 0.5mg/ bird S. Typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to evaluate whether response was similar for vaccine and endotoxin. Birds were weighed, and rectal temperatures recorded at the time of injection, then observed over 24 hours. Rectal temperatures were measured and blood samples collected for serum IL-6 assay at 3 hours post injection (PI). At 12 hours PI blood samples were drawn for analyses for plasma phosphorus (P), glucose (Glu), cholesterol (Cho), aspartate transaminase (AST), total protein (Ptn) and creatinine kinase (CK). Blood was sampled 14 days PI and tested for serum antibody to S. Typhimurium. Vaccination resulted in significant seroconversion by 14 days PI in all strains compared to the controls. The three layer strains exhibited a clinical malaise, evident within 90 minutes of injection, lasting for 12 hours, with complete recovery by 24 hours PI. Only the 10(8) CFU dose given subcutaneously produced an increase in rectal temperature 3 hours PI. Vaccination had no effect on IL-6 or Ptn. All vaccine doses increased P and the higher dose by either route decreased Cho in all bird strains. The 10(8) vaccine dose increased Glu and intramuscular injection markedly elevated CK only in the layer strains. The response was not completely congruous with that to LPS alone. The results highlight the need for consideration of differences in response of bird strain when consideration is given to the parenteral administration of live Salmonella vaccines.

26011867|t|On Integration and Validation of a Very Low Complexity ATC UWB System for Muscle Force Transmission.
26011867|a|UNASSIGNED: The thresholding of Surface ElectroMyoGraphic (sEMG) signals, i.e., Average Threshold Crossing (ATC) technique, reduces the amount of data to be processed enabling circuit complexity reduction and low power consumption. This paper investigates the lowest level of complexity reachable by an ATC system through measurements and in-vivo experiments with an embedded prototype for wireless force transmission, based on asynchronous Impulse-Radio Ultra Wide Band (IR-UWB). The prototype is composed by the acquisition unit, a wearable PCB 23 * 34 mm, which includes a full custom IC integrating a UWB transmitter (chip active silicon area 0.016 mm (2), 1 mW power consumption), and the receiver. The system is completely asynchronous, it acquires a differential sEMG signal, generates the ATC events and triggers a 3.3 GHz IR-UWB transmission. ATC robustness relaxes filters constraints: two passive first order filters have been implemented, bandwidth from 10 Hz up to 1 kHz . Energy needed for the single pulse generation is 30 pJ while the whole PCB consumes 5.65 mW. The pulses radiated by the acquisition unit TX are received by a short-range and low complexity threshold-based 130 nm CMOS IR-UWB receiver with an Ultra Low Power (ULP) baseband unit capable of robustly receiving generic quasi-digital pulse sequences. The acquisition unit have been tested with 10 series of in vivo isometric and isotonic contractions, while the transmission channel with over-the-air and cable measurements obtained with a couple of planar monopole antennas and an integrated 0.004 mm (2) transmitter, the same used for the acquisition unit, with realistic channel conditions. The entire system, acquisition unit and receiver, consumes 15.49 mW.

26111206|t|Differential Evolution approach to detect recent admixture.
26111206|a|UNASSIGNED: The genetic structure of human populations is extraordinarily complex and of fundamental importance to studies of anthropology, evolution, and medicine. As increasingly many individuals are of mixed origin, there is an unmet need for tools that can infer multiple origins. Misclassification of such individuals can lead to incorrect and costly misinterpretations of genomic data, primarily in disease studies and drug trials. We present an advanced tool to infer ancestry that can identify the biogeographic origins of highly mixed individuals. reAdmix can incorporate individual's knowledge of ancestors (e.g. having some ancestors from Turkey or a Scottish grandmother). reAdmix is an online tool available at http://chcb.saban-chla.usc.edu/reAdmix/.

26111053|t|Flowcytometric measurement of platelet associated immunoglobulin in children with newly diagnosed Immune Thrombocytopenia.
26111053|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical utility of measuring platelet associated immunoglobulin (PAIG) at the time of diagnosis in children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). METHODS: PAIG was measured by flow cytometry using fluorescent murine anti-IgG and anti-IgM. In a cohort of 88 children with ITP the assay was performed within 15 days of diagnosis and before any treatment in 68 cases. We reviewed the results and examined the relation of isotype profile and degree of elevation to clinical manifestations and course of disease. RESULTS: PAIG was elevated in 74%, with raised IgM being more frequent than IgG (63% vs. 44%, p=0.04) and with isotype profile depending on symptom onset. Platelet counts at presentation were similar in all subgroups, but mucosal bleeding was less frequent in PAIG negative patients compared to the positive groups (5.5% vs. 34%, p=0.03). Duration of thrombocytopenia was similar in negative and positive cases, but during follow-up significant bleeding events occurred less frequently inPAIG-negative patients (0% vs. 14%, p = 0.18). CONCLUSION: Approximately one quarter of children are PAIG-negative, and these children have milder bleeding tendency at diagnosis and lower morbidity during follow-up. Raised PAIG possibly may cause some degree of platelet dysfunction. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

26109536|t|Optimizing outcomes in the elderly with end-stage renal disease-live long and prosper.
26109536|a|BACKGROUND: The elderly form an expanding proportion of patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease worldwide. The increased physiological frailty and functional morbidity associated with the aging process pose unique challenges when planning optimal management of an older patient needing renal replacement therapy (RRT). AIMS: This position paper discusses current evidence regarding the optimal management of end-stage renal disease in the elderly with an emphasis on hemodialysis since it is the most common modality used in older patients. Further research is needed to define relevant patient-reported outcome measures for end-stage renal disease including functional assessments and psychological impacts of various forms of RRT. For those older patients who have opted for dialysis treatment, it is important to study the strategies that encourage greater uptake of home-based dialysis therapies and optimal vascular access. CONCLUSIONS: The management of advanced chronic kidney disease in the elderly can be challenging but also extremely rewarding. The key issue is adopting a patient-focused and individualized approach that seeks to achieve the best outcomes based on a comprehensive holistic assessment of what is important to the patient.

26003504|t|Adherence to the ESC Heart Failure Treatment Guidelines in Spain: ESC Heart Failure Long-term Registry.
26003504|a|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To estimate the percentage of heart failure patients in Spain that received the European Society of Cardiology recommended treatments, and in those that did not, to determine the reasons why. METHODS: The study included 2834 consecutive ambulatory patients with heart failure from 27  Spanish hospitals. We recorded general information, the treatment indicated, and the reasons why it was not prescribed in some cases. In patients who met the criteria to receive a certain drug, true undertreatment was defined as the percentage of patients who, without justification, did not receive the drug. RESULTS: In total, 92.6% of ambulatory patients with low ejection fraction received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, 93.3% beta-blockers, and 74.5% mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The true undertreatment rates were 3.4%, 1.8%, and 19.0%, respectively. Target doses were reached in 16.2% of patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, 23.3% of those with angiotensin receptor blockers, 13.2% of those prescribed beta-blockers, and 23.5% of those with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Among patients who could benefit from ivabradine, 29.1% received this drug. In total, 36% of patients met the criteria for defibrillator implantation and 90% of them had received the device or were scheduled for implantation, whereas 19.6% fulfilled the criteria for resynchronization therapy and 88.0% already had or would soon have the device. In patients who met the criteria, but did not undergo device implantation, the reasons were not cost-related. CONCLUSIONS: When justified reasons for not administering heart failure drugs were taken into account, adherence to the guideline recommendations was excellent. Exclusive use of the percentage of treated patients is a poor indicator of the quality of healthcare in heart failure. Measures should be taken to improve the attainment of optimal dosing in each patient.

26046504|a|UNASSIGNED: The high morbidity and mortality associated with cervical spine injuries makes identification and classification essential. It is important to have a systematic approach to evaluation, especially in the trauma setting with other distracting injuries. Understanding the anatomy and biomechanics enables rapid and accurate interpretation of images. In severe trauma and in patients with rigid spinal disease, the classic patterns of injury may be difficult or impossible to recognize. This article provides an approach to acquiring and interpreting cervical spine images in the setting of acute trauma and reviews the classic patterns of injury.

26009651|t|Evaluation of antioxidant producing potential of halophilic bacterial bionts from marine invertebrates.
26009651|a|Marine invertebrates exposed to high levels of reactive oxygen species in the oceans have been reported to produce antioxidants as a major defense against free radical mediated toxicity; protecting their tissues from the damage associated with the oxidative stress. In view of this, the present study was carried out to determine the antioxidant activity of 100 bacterial bionts isolated from marine sponges, corals and a single bivalve. Methanol extract of biont GUVFCFM-3 produced 67.83% scavenging of 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radicals and 65.87% scavenging of superoxide free radicals. Preliminary tests leading to the identification of the extracellular antioxidant factor produced by GUVFCFM-3 revealed that it is a peptide. We report that the genera Chromohalobacter sp. primarily known for its unique salt tolerating abilities by virtue of the production of osmolytes is an excellent scavenger of free radicals.

26012303|t|[Expression of AMCase mRNA in nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis in SD rats].
26012303|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine AMCase mRNA expression levels in nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis SD rats. METHOD: Thirty SD rats were chosen and randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group. 20 in experimental group and 10 in the control group. AR model rats were established through repeated intraperitoneal shot of ovalbumin (OVA) for 2 weeks and consequently confirmed by local challenge with OVA for 1 week. The control group was treated by the same method with Physiological saline water instead of OVA. After the last excitation allergic rhinitis was diagnosed according to the accumulation score about nasal symptom. The septal mucosa of all rats were used to diagnose pathologically by HE dyeing. AMCase mRNA in nasal mucosa, obtained from the bilateral nasal mucosa in two groups, were used to do reverse transcriptive polymerase chain reaction. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to examine AMCase mRNA expression levels. RESULT: (1) The results showed definitely that there were positive expression of AMCase mRNA in normal nasal mucosa. This expression increase significantly during nasal allergy (P < 0.05). (2) The increased expression of AMCase mRNA in allergic rhinitis are related with the nasal symptoms score (r = 0.411, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Increased expression of AMCase mRNA in nasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis model might play roles in the pathogenesis of AR, and Restrain the enzyme activity could become new treatment targets of allergic rhinitis.

26013376|t|Dengue Seroprevalence of Healthy Adults in Singapore: Serosurvey Among Blood Donors, 2009.
26013376|a|UNASSIGNED: Routine national notifications of dengue cases typically do not reflect the true dengue situation due to large proportion of unreported cases. Serosurveys, when conducted periodically, could shed light on the true dengue infections in the population. To determine the magnitude of dengue infections of the adult population in Singapore following the outbreak in 2007, we performed a cross-sectional study on blood donor samples from December 2009 to February 2010. The residual blood of 3,995 donors (aged 16-60 years) was screened for the presence of dengue-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The age-weighted IgG prevalence of residents was 50.8% (N = 3,627, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 49.4-52.3%). Dengue IgG prevalence increased with age, with the lowest in 16-20 years age group (16.1%) and the highest in 56-60 years age group (86.6%). Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) on samples of young resident adults (aged 16-30 years) revealed lower prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to each serotype, ranging from 5.4% to 20.3% compared with the older age groups. The level of exposure to dengue among the young adults is relatively low despite the endemicity of the disease in Singapore. It partially explains the population's susceptibility to explosive outbreaks and the high incidence rate among young adults.

26016605|t|Intraocular and systemic inflammation-related cytokines during one year of ranibizumab treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.
26016605|a|PURPOSE: To determine inflammation-related intraocular and systemic cytokine concentrations in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) compared with controls and to assess the influence of long-term intravitreal ranibizumab treatment over 1  year. METHODS: Aqueous humour and blood plasma of 21 controls and 17 treatment-naive nAMD patients were collected prior to cataract surgery or ranibizumab treatment. Follow-up specimens in nAMD patients were acquired immediately prior to subsequent ranibizumab injections as needed. Multiplex bead assays were conducted for ten inflammation-related cytokines and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). p-values were Holm-Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Prior to ranibizumab treatment, initiation aqueous humour levels of monocyte chemo-attractant protein (MCP)-1/CCL2 (p  =  0.005) and vascular cell adhesin molecule (VCAM) (p  =  0.002) were elevated in nAMD compared with controls. Other intraocular cytokines did not differ, including VEGF. In plasma, no differences between nAMD patients and controls were found at baseline. Pro re nata ranibizumab treatment over 12  months with 8      2 injections reduced aqueous VEGF (p  <  0.0001) with a trend to reduced VEGF plasma concentrations (p  =  0.046), with all specimens taken at least 28  days after the previous injection. All other local and systemic cytokines remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: Neovascular age-related macular degeneration is associated with local ocular MCP-1/CCL2 and VCAM elevations, suggesting a local inflammatory involvement in the pathophysiology of nAMD. We did not detect systemic differences. Ranibizumab treatment does not result in local or systemic changes of these cytokines, in contrast to VEGF suppression. MCP-1/CCL2 and VCAM may be potential additional treatment targets for nAMD.

26020429|t|Agile, a guiding principle for health care improvement?
26020429|a|UNASSIGNED: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to increased understanding of the concept agile and its potential for hospital managers to optimize design of organizational structures and processes to combine internal efficiency and external effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach - An integrative review was conducted using the reSEARCH database. Articles met the following criteria: first, a definition of agility; second, descriptions of enablers of becoming an agile organization; and finally, discussions of agile on multiple organizational levels. In total, 60 articles qualified for the final analysis. Findings - Organizational agility rests on the assumption that the environment is uncertain, ranging from frequently changing to highly unpredictable. Proactive, reactive or embracive coping strategies were described as possible ways to handle such uncertain environments. Five organizational capacities were derived as necessary for hospitals to use the strategies optimally: transparent and transient inter-organizational links; market sensitivity and customer focus; management by support for self-organizing employees; organic structures that are elastic and responsive; flexible human and resource capacity for timely delivery. Agile is portrayed as either the "new paradigm" following lean, the needed development on top of a lean base, or as complementary to lean in distinct hybrid strategies. Practical implications - Environmental uncertainty needs to be matched with coping strategies and organizational capacities to design processes responsive to real needs of health care. This implies that lean and agile can be combined to optimize the design of hospitals, to meet different variations in demand and create good patient management. Originality/value - While considerable value has been paid to strategies to improve the internal efficiency within hospitals, this review raise the attention to the value of strategies of external effectiveness.

26016908|t|Self-Organizing Distributed Architecture Supporting Dynamic Space Expanding and Reducing in Indoor LBS Environment.
26016908|a|Indoor location-based services (iLBS) are extremely dynamic and changeable, and include numerous resources and mobile devices. In particular, the network infrastructure requires support for high scalability in the indoor environment, and various resource lookups are requested concurrently and frequently from several locations based on the dynamic network environment. A traditional map-based centralized approach for iLBSs has several disadvantages: it requires global knowledge to maintain a complete geographic indoor map; the central server is a single point of failure; it can also cause low scalability and traffic congestion; and it is hard to adapt to a change of service area in real time. This paper proposes a self-organizing and fully distributed platform for iLBSs. The proposed self-organizing distributed platform provides a dynamic reconfiguration of locality accuracy and service coverage by expanding and contracting dynamically. In order to verify the suggested platform, scalability performance according to the number of inserted or deleted nodes composing the dynamic infrastructure was evaluated through a simulation similar to the real environment.

26061371|t|A historical overview of leprosy epidemiology and control activities in Amazonas, Brazil.
26061371|a|UNASSIGNED: Leprosy is an ancient infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. According to comparative genomics studies, this disease originated in Eastern Africa or the Near East and spread with successive human migrations. The Europeans and North Africans introduced leprosy into West Africa and the Americas within the past 500 years. In Brazil, this disease arrived with the colonizers who disembarked at the first colonies, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and Recife, at the end of the sixteenth century, after which it was spread to the other states. In 1854, the first leprosy cases were identified in State of Amazonas in the north of Brazil. The increasing number of leprosy cases and the need for treatment and disease control led to the creation of places to isolate patients, known as leprosaria. One of them, Colonia Ant  nio Aleixo was built in Amazonas in 1956 according to the most advanced recommendations for isolation at that time and was deactivated in 1979. The history of the Alfredo da Matta Center (AMC), which was the first leprosy dispensary created in 1955, parallels the history of leprosy in the state. Over the years, the AMC has become one of the best training centers for leprosy, general dermatology and sexually transmitted diseases in Brazil. In addition to being responsible for leprosy control programs in the state, the AMC has carried out training programs on leprosy diagnosis and treatment for health professionals in Manaus and other municipalities of the state, aiming to increase the coverage of leprosy control activities. This paper provides a historical overview of leprosy in State of Amazonas, which is an endemic state in Brazil.

26052366|t|Lessons Learned from Animal Models of Inherited Bleeding Disorders.
26052366|a|UNASSIGNED: Advances in treatment of hemophilia and von Willebrand disease (VWD) depend heavily on the availability of well-characterized animal models. These animals faithfully recapitulate the severe bleeding phenotype that occurs in humans with these inherited bleeding disorders. Research in these animal models represents important early and intermediate steps of translational research aimed at addressing current limitations in treatment such as the development of inhibitory antibodies to coagulation factors VIII and IX (FVIII, FIX) or von Willebrand factor (VWF), the life-long need for frequent venous access, the expense of therapy, and the ongoing need for improved ex vivo coagulation assays and in vivo methods for assessing hemostasis. The primary strengths of research that utilizes these highly relevant animal models include the development of better and safer treatments for hemophilia and VWD. Careful consideration of the strengths and limitations of the specific models is essential for optimizing chances for successful translation of advances to clinical medicine that benefits humans and animals.

26061690|t|Prevalence and Incidence of Hypoglycaemia in 532,542 People with Type 2 Diabetes on Oral Therapies and Insulin: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Population Based Studies.
26061690|a|OBJECTIVE: To collate and evaluate the current literature reporting the prevalence and incidence of hypoglycaemia in population based studies of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Medline, Embase and Cochrane were searched up to February 2014 to identify population based studies reporting the proportion of people with type 2 diabetes experiencing hypoglycaemia or rate of events experienced. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility and extracted data for included studies. Random effects meta-analyses were carried out to calculate the prevalence and incidence of hypoglycaemia. RESULTS: 46 studies (n = 532,542) met the inclusion criteria. Prevalence of hypoglycaemia was 45% (95%CI 0.34,0.57) for mild/moderate and 6% (95%CI, 0.05,0.07) for severe. Incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes per person-year for mild/moderate and for severe was 19 (95%CI 0.00, 51.08) and 0.80 (95%CI 0.00,2.15), respectively. Hypoglycaemia was prevalent amongst those on insulin; for mild/moderate episodes the prevalence was 50% and incidence 23 events per person-year, and for severe episodes the prevalence was 21% and incidence 1 event per person-year. For treatment regimes that included a sulphonylurea, mild/moderate prevalence was 30% and incidence 2 events per person-year, and severe prevalence was 5% and incidence 0.01 events per person-year. A similar prevalence of 5% was found for treatment regimes that did not include sulphonylureas. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence shows hypoglycaemia is considerably prevalent amongst people with type 2 diabetes, particularly for those on insulin, yet still fairly common for other treatment regimens. This highlights the subsequent need for educational interventions and individualisation of therapies to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia.

26052470|t|Differential Specificity of Interferon-alpha Inducible Gene Expression in Association with Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Hepatitis C Virus Levels and Declines in vivo.
26052470|a|OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to correlate in vivo interferon (IFN) inducible gene (IFIG) expression and IFIG induction with viral-load (VL) and VL-kinetics of Human-Immunodeficiency-Virus (HIV) or Hepatitis-C-Virus (HCV) in HIV-positive patients treated with pegylated IFN-alpha-2a (PegIFNa). METHODS: HIV mono-infected patients (N=8) and HIV/HCV co-infected patients (N=23, without HIV-viremia) were treated with PegIFNa (180  g/week) for 12 and 48 weeks, respectively. Blood sampling for monitoring IFIG expression occurred at day_0 and week_3, _6 and _12 for HIV mono-infected patients vs. only at day_0 and week_48 for HIV/HCV co-infected subjects. IFIG expression (N=20) was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by bDNA-assay. VL levels/changes in plasma were analyzed for correlation with IFIG expression/induction at/between selected time points. Overall, P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: None of the 20 IFIG expression profiles at day_0 correlated significantly with HIV-VL at day_0. Expression at day_0 of 3 IFIG (APOBEC3G/OAS1/OAS2) correlated significantly (r>+0.42/P<0.05) with HCV-VL at day_0. The strongest antiviral effect [measured as median viral decline per week:   VL/week (log10)] occurred in common against HIV and HCV between day_0 and week_3 during 12 weeks of continuous PegIFNa treatment in both cohorts. Expression at day_0 of 1 IFIG (APOBEC3A) correlated significantly (r<-0.71/P<0.05) with HIV-  VL/week (log10) from day_0 to week_3. No significance was reached in correlations between expression values of 20 IFIG at day_0 and HCV-  VL/week (log10) from day_0 to week_3. No significant correlation was detected between IFIG expression changes (  IFIG=induction) from day_0 to week_3 and HIV-  VL/week (log10) from day_0 to week_3. Interestingly, induction of 1 IFIG (  ISG20) from day_0 to week_48 was significantly associated (P<0.05) with permanent HCV clearance. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the differential specificity of PegIFNa mediated molecular actions by dissecting the kinetics of IFIG expression and induction, suggesting multiple, possibly non-overlapping mechanisms for antiviral effects against HCV and HIV.

26055918|t|Leucine and histidine independently regulate milk protein synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells via mTOR signaling pathway.
26055918|a|The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of leucine (Leu) and histidine (His) on the expression of both the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway-related proteins and caseins in immortalized bovine mammary epithelial cells (CMEC-H), using a single supplement through Western blotting. The Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS) was set as the control group and other treatment groups, based on the EBSS, were added with different concentrations of Leu or His, respectively. The results showed that, compared with the control group, the expression of caseins and the phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser(2481)), Raptor (Ser(792)), eIF4E (Ser(209)), and eEF2 (Thr(56)) increased with the Leu concentrations ranging from 0.45 to 10.80 mmol/L (P<0.01). The P-4EBP1 (Thr(37)) at 10.80 mmol/L Leu, and P-RPS6 (Ser(235/236)) at 5.40 to 10.80 mmol/L Leu all decreased. Similarly, the His supplementation from 0.15 to 9.60 mmol/L increased the expression of as2-casein, b-casein, k-casein, P-mTOR (Ser(2481)), P-Raptor (Ser(792)), P-S6K1 (Thr(389)), P-4EBP1 (Thr(37)), P-eIF4E (Ser(209)), and P-eEF2 (Thr(56)) (P<0.01) in CMEC-H, whereas the as1-casein expression was only reduced at 9.60 mmol/L His, G protein b subunit-like protein (GbL) at 0.15 and 9.60 mmol/L His, and P-RPS6 at 4.80 to 9.60 mmol/L His. Our linear regression model assay suggested that the as1-casein expression was positively correlated with P-mTOR (P<0.01), P-S6K1 (P<0.01), and P-eEF2 (P<0.01) for the addition of Leu, while the expressions of b-casein (P<0.01) and k-casein (P<0.01) were positively correlated with P-eEF2 for the addition of His. In conclusion, the milk protein synthesis was up-regulated through activation of the mTOR pathway with the addition of Leu and His in CMEC-H.

26056551|t|Effects of pyridoxine supplementation on severity, frequency and duration of migraine attacks in migraine patients with aura: A double-blind randomized clinical trial study in Iran.
26056551|a|BACKGROUND: Migraine is a chronic disease that affects nearly 6% of men and 18% of women worldwide. There are various drugs, which can successfully decrease migraine symptoms and frequency of migraine attacks, but these drugs usually are expensive. Hence, this study aimed to assess the effects of pyridoxine supplementation on severity, frequency and duration of migraine attacks as well as headache diary results (HDR). METHODS: This double-blind randomized clinical trial study was conducted on 66 patients with migraine with aura (MA) in Khorshid and Emam Mosa Sadr clinics of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran, in 2013. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either pyridoxine supplements (80 mg pyridoxine per day) or placebo. Severity, frequency and duration of migraine attacks and HDR were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 34.24    9.44 years old. Pyridoxine supplementation led to a significant decrease in headache severity (-2.20    1.70 compared with -1    1.50; P = 0.007), attacks duration (-8.30    12.60 compared with -1.70    9.60; P = 0.030) and HDR (-89.70    134.60 compared with -6.10    155.50; P = 0.040) compared with placebo, but was not effective on the frequency of migraine attacks (-2.30    4 compared with -1.20    7.80; P = 0.510). CONCLUSION: Pyridoxine supplementation in patients with MA was effective on headache severity, attacks duration and HDR, but did not affect the frequency of migraine attacks.

26055400|t|Efficacy and safety of acupuncture for dizziness and vertigo in emergency department: a pilot cohort study.
26055400|a|BACKGROUND: Dizziness and vertigo account for roughly 4% of chief symptoms in the emergency department (ED). Pharmacological therapy is often applied for these symptoms, such as vestibular suppressants, anti-emetics and benzodiazepines. However, every medication is accompanied with unavoidable side-effects. There are several research articles providing evidence of acupuncture treating dizziness and vertigo but few studies of acupuncture as an emergent intervention in ED. We performed a pilot cohort study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in treating patients with dizziness and vertigo in ED. METHODS: A total of 60 participants, recruited in ED, were divided into acupuncture and control group. Life-threatening conditions or central nervous system disorders were excluded to ensure participants' safety. The clinical effect of treating dizziness and vertigo was evaluated by performing statistical analyses on data collected from questionnaires of Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of dizziness and vertigo, and heart rate variability (HRV). RESULTS: The variation of VAS demonstrated a significant decrease (p-value: 0.001 and p-value: 0.037) between two groups after two different durations: 30 mins and 7  days. The variation of DHI showed no significant difference after 7  days. HRV revealed a significant increase in high frequency (HF) in the acupuncture group. No adverse event was reported in this study. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture demonstrates a significant immediate effect in reducing discomforts and VAS of both dizziness and vertigo. This study provides clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of acupuncture to treat dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02358239 .

26071689|t|C60 fullerene affects elastic properties and osmoregulation reactions of human lymphocytes.
26071689|a|UNASSIGNED: The influence of aqueous solution of pristine C60 fullerene (C60FAS) on functional activity of lymphocytes from a healthy person was studied for the first time. By means of atomic force microscopy, it was found that C60FAS in a concentration of 0.1  mg/ml increases the stiffness of the lymphocyte membrane by 41  % (p  <  0.05) and lowers the functional activity of the plasmalemma surface, thereby constraining the use of its membrane material in physiological reactions using a hypotonic model in vitro. However, a cell retains the ability to regulate its volume and demonstrates relative resistance to hypo-osmotic stress. The resistance of lymphocytes in hypo-osmotic medium is facilitated by activation of the nucleus by C60 fullerene particles, which regulates the implementation of two consistent phases of an increase and decrease of cell volume, thereby retaining cell viability. All these indicate the impact of C60 fullerene on the cellular nucleus.

26045300|t|Protective effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on aging Sca  -1+ hematopoietic cells.
26045300|a|UNASSIGNED: In adults, bone hematopoietic cells are responsible for the lifelong production of all blood cells. It is affected in aging, with progressive loss of physiological integrity leading to impaired function by cellular intrinsic and extrinsic factors. However, intervention measures, which directly inhibit the aging of hematopoietic cells, remain to be investigated. In the present study, 10    mol/l ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) markedly alleviated the aging phenotypes of Sca  -1+ hematopoietic cells following in  vitro exposure. In addition, the protective effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on the aging of Sca  -1+ hematopoietic cells was confirmed using a serial transplantation assay in C57BL/6 mice. The mechanistic investigations revealed that Rg1  -mediated Sca  -1+ hematopoietic cell aging alleviation was linked to a series of characteristic events, including telomere end attrition compensation, telomerase activity reconstitution and the activation of genes involved in p16  -Rb signaling pathways. Based on the above results, it was concluded that ginsenoside Rg1 is a potent agent, which acts on hematopoietic cells to protect them from aging, which has implications for therapeutic approaches in hemopoietic diseases.

26044206|t|Effects of insulin degludec and insulin glargine on day-to-day fasting plasma glucose variability in individuals with type 1 diabetes: a multicentre, randomised, crossover study.
26044206|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We compared the effects of insulin degludec (IDeg; Des(B30)LysB29(y-Glu N  -hexadecandioyl) human insulin) and insulin glargine (IGlar; A21Gly,B31Arg,B32Arg human insulin) on the day-to-day variability of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels in individuals with type 1 diabetes treated with basal-bolus insulin injections. METHODS: The effects of basal-bolus insulin therapy for 4  weeks with either IDeg or IGlar as the basal insulin in adult C-peptide-negative outpatients with type 1 diabetes were investigated in an open-label, multicentre, randomised, crossover trial. Randomisation was conducted using a centralised allocation process. The primary endpoints were the SD and CV of FPG during the final week of each treatment period. Secondary endpoints included serum glycoalbumin level, daily dose of insulin, intraday glycaemic variability and frequency of severe hypoglycaemia. RESULTS: Thirty-six randomised participants (17 in the IDeg/IGlar and 19 in the IGlar/IDeg groups) were recruited, and data for 32 participants who completed the trial were analysed. The mean (7.74        1.76 vs 8.56        2.06  mmol/l; p   =   0.04) and SD (2.60        0.97 vs 3.19        1.36  mmol/l; p   =   0.03) of FPG were lower during IDeg treatment than during IGlar treatment, whereas the CV did not differ between the two treatments. The dose of IDeg was smaller than that of IGlar (11.0        5.2 vs 11.8        5.6  U/day; p   <   0.01), but other secondary endpoints did not differ between the treatments. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: IDeg yielded a lower FPG level and smaller day-to-day variability of FPG at a lower daily dose compared with IGlar in participants with type 1 diabetes. IDeg serves as a good option for basal insulin in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: University Hospital Medical Information Network 000009965.

26041783|t|Indole and tryptophan metabolism: endogenous and dietary routes to Ah receptor activation.
26041783|a|UNASSIGNED: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor recognized for its role in xenobiotic metabolism. The physiological function of the AHR has expanded to include roles in immune regulation, organogenesis, mucosal barrier function, and cell cycle. These functions are likely dependent upon ligand-mediated activation of the receptor. High affinity ligands of the AHR have been classically defined as xenobiotics, such as polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins. Identification of endogenous AHR ligands is key to understanding the physiological functions of this enigmatic receptor. Metabolic pathways targeting the amino acid tryptophan and indole can lead to a myriad of metabolites, some of which are AHR ligands. Many of these ligands exhibit species selective preferential binding to the AHR. The discovery of specific tryptophan metabolites as AHR ligands may provide insight concerning where the AHR is activated in an organism, such as at the site of inflammation and within the intestinal tract.

26050227|t|Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs in colorectal cancer with liver metastasis.
26050227|a|UNASSIGNED: Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays a crucial role in the regulation of various cellular processes and human diseases. However, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in colorectal liver metastasis (CLM). In the present study, we aimed to determine whether lncRNAs are differentially expressed in CLM tissue and to further assess their clinical value. lncRNA arrays were employed to screen for differentially expressed lncRNAs in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues with synchronous, metachronous, or nonliver metastasis. Based on bioinformatics data, a quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was performed to identify target lncRNAs in an expanded set of CRC samples with various subtypes of liver metastasis. The relationships between the target lncRNAs and the clinical characteristics and patient prognosis were further analyzed. After determining the expression profile of lncRNAs (n   =   1332) in CLM tissue, 40 differentially expressed lncRNAs that were potentially related to CLM were selected for further examination in an expanded set of clinical samples, and three novel target lncRNAs, termed lncRNA-CLMAT1-3, were verified. High lncRNA-CLMAT3 expression strongly correlated with liver metastasis (P   =   0.03) and lymph node metastasis (P   =   0.009). Moreover, patients displaying high lncRNA-CLMAT3 expression exhibited a shorter median overall survival duration than those displaying low lncRNA-CLMAT3 expression (30.7 vs. 35.2  months, P   =   0.007). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the lncRNA-CLMAT3 expression level is an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio 2.05, P   =   0.02) after adjusting for other known prognostic factors. lncRNA-CLMAT3 over-expression was significantly associated with CLM and was an independent predictor of poor survival for patients with CRC.

26030282|t|Study of Displacement Efficiency and Flow Behavior of Foamed Gel in Non-Homogeneous Porous Media.
26030282|a|UNASSIGNED: Field trials have demonstrated that foamed gel is a very cost-effective technology for profile modification and water shut-off. However, the mechanisms of profile modification and flow behavior of foamed gel in non-homogeneous porous media are not yet well understood. In order to investigate these mechanisms and the interactions between foamed gel and oil in porous media, coreflooding and pore-scale visualization waterflooding experiments were performed in the laboratory. The results of the coreflooding experiment in non-homogeneous porous media showed that the displacement efficiency improved by approximately 30% after injecting a 0.3 pore volume of foamed gel, and was proportional to the pore volumes of the injected foamed gel. Additionally, the mid-high permeability zone can be selectively plugged by foamed gel, and then oil located in the low permeability zone will be displaced. The visualization images demonstrated that the amoeba effect and Jamin effect are the main mechanisms for enhancing oil recovery by foamed gel. Compared with conventional gel, a unique benefit of foamed gel is that it can pass through micropores by transforming into arbitrary shapes without rupturing, this phenomenon has been named the amoeba effect. Additionally, the stability of foam in the presence of crude oil also was investigated. Image and statistical analysis showed that these foams boast excellent oil resistance and elasticity, which allows them to work deep within formations.

26046749|a|UNASSIGNED: Fullerene (C60) L-phenylalanine derivative attached with poly (lactic acid) (C60-phe-PLA) was developed to prepare injectable Mitoxantrone (MTX) multifunctional implants. C60-phe-PLA was self-assembled to form microspheres consisting of a hydrophilic antitumor drug (MTX) and a hydrophobic block (C60) by dispersion-solvent diffusion method. The self-assembled microspheres showed sustained release pattern almost 15days in vitro release experiments. According to the tissue distribution of C57BL mice after intratumoral administration of the microspheres, the MTX mainly distributed in tumors, and rarely in heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney. Photodynamic antitumor efficacy of blank microsphere was realized. Microspheres afforded high antitumor efficacy without obvious toxic effects to normal organs, owing to its significantly increased MTX tumor retention time, low MTX levels in normal organs and strong photodynamic activity of PLA-phe-C60. These C60-phe-PLA microspheres may be promising for the efficacy with minimal side effects in future treatment of solid tumors.

26115702|t|SNX15 Regulates Cell Surface Recycling of APP and Ab Generation.
26115702|a|UNASSIGNED: Amyloid-b (Ab) peptide plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is generated from amyloid-b precursor protein (APP) through sequential proteolytic cleavages by b-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and y-secretase. Trafficking dysregulation of APP, BACE1, and y-secretase may affect Ab generation and disease pathogenesis. Sorting nexin 15 (SNX15) is known to regulate protein trafficking. Here, we report that SNX15 is abundantly expressed in mouse neurons and astrocytes. In addition, we show that although not affecting the protein levels of APP, BACE1, and y-secretase components and the activity of BACE1 and y-secretase, overexpression and downregulation of SNX15 reduce and promote Ab production, respectively. Furthermore, we find that overexpression of SNX15 increases APP protein levels in cell surface through accelerating APP recycling, whereas downregulation of SNX15 has an opposite effect. Finally, we show that exogenous expression of human SNX15 in the hippocampal dentate gyrus by adeno-associated virus (AAV) infection can significantly reduce Ab pathology in the hippocampus and improve short-term working memory in the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 double transgenic AD model mice. Together, our results suggest that SNX15 regulates the recycling of APP to cell surface and, thus, its processing for Ab generation.

26086106|t|Establishment and culture optimization of a new type of pituitary immortalized cell line.
26086106|a|UNASSIGNED: The pituitary gland is a center of the endocrine system that controls homeostasis in an organism by secreting various hormones. The glandular anterior pituitary consists of five different cell types, each expressing specific hormones. However, their regulation and the appropriate conditions for their in  vitro culture are not well defined. Here, we report the immortalization of mouse pituitary cells by introducing TERT, E6, and E7 transgenes. The immortalized cell lines mainly expressed a thyrotroph-specific thyroid stimulating hormone beta (Tshb). After optimization of the culture conditions, these immortalized cells proliferated and maintained morphological characteristics similar to those of primary pituitary cells under sphere culture conditions in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with N2, B27, basic FGF, and EGF. These cell lines responded to PKA or PKC pathway activators and induced the expression of Tshb mRNA. Moreover, transplantation of the immortalized cell line into subcutaneous regions and kidney capsules of mice further increased Tshb expression. These results suggest that immortalization of pituitary cells with TERT, E6, and E7 transgenes is a useful method for generating proliferating cells for the in  vitro analysis of pituitary regulatory mechanisms.

26117526|t|Outcome following postanoxic status epilepticus in patients with targeted temperature management after cardiac arrest.
26117526|a|BACKGROUND: Postanoxic electrographic status epilepticus (ESE) is considered a predictor of poor outcome in resuscitated patients after cardiac arrest (CA). Observational data suggest that a subgroup of patients may have a good outcome. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of ESE and potential clinical and electrographic prognostic markers. METHODS: In this retrospective single study, we analyzed consecutive patients who suffered from CA, and who received temperature management and were monitored with simplified continuous EEG (cEEG) during a five-year period. The patients' charts and cEEG data were initially screened to identify patients with clinical seizures or ESE. The cEEG diagnosis of ESE was retrospectively reanalyzed according to strict criteria by a neurophysiologist blinded to patient outcome. The EEG background patterns prior to the onset of ESE, duration of ESE, presence of clinical seizures, and use of antiepileptic drugs were analyzed. The results of somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) at 48h after CA were described in all patients with ESE. Antiepileptic treatment strategies were not protocolized. Outcome was evaluated using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale at 6months, and good outcome was defined as CPC 1-2. RESULTS: Of 127 patients, 41 (32%) developed ESE. Twenty-five patients had a discontinuous EEG background prior to ESE, and all died without regaining consciousness. Sixteen patients developed a continuous EEG background prior to the start of ESE, four of whom survived, three with CPC 1-2 and one with CPC 3 at 6months. Among survivors, ESE developed at a median of 46h after CA. All had preserved N20 peaks on SSEP and NSE values of 18-37 g/l. CONCLUSION: Electrographic status epilepticus is common among comatose patients after cardiac arrest, with few survivors. A combination of a continuous EEG background prior to ESE, preserved N20 peaks on SSEPs, and low or moderately elevated NSE levels may indicate a good outcome.

26057922|t|Mandibular Coronoid Fractures, How Rare?
26057922|a|BACKGROUND: To study the rarity of mandibular coronoid process fractures and treatment strategies based on the displacement of these fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 11 cases of coronoid process fractures among 307 treated cases from 2008 to 2013 was conducted. Six patients were treated conservatively and 5 underwent ORIF with associated fractures. A statistical analysis of the data obtained after subjective and objective evaluation was done. RESULTS: The incidence of coronoid process fractures was 3.58% of all mandibular fractures analyzed. There was no statistically significant difference found between two treatment modalities, but differences in maximum interincisal opening (MIO) and pain in the postoperative period were significant. CONCLUSION: We recommend that linear coronoid fractures with minimal displacement can be managed with conservative treatment. For patients with significant displacement of coronoid process, limited mouth opening or concomitant mid-face or lower-face fractures, rigid internal fixation is recommended.

26056674|t|Personality Traits and Their Relationship to Demographic Features in Addicts Referring to a Drug Rehabilitation Center in the City of Isfahan, Iran.
26056674|a|BACKGROUND: Addiction is one of the most serious social damages and due to its progressive nature in all aspects, adversely affects people's physical and psychological health. Hence, this paper investigates the characteristics of drug addicts in a drug rehabilitation center in the city of Isfahan. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study conducted in 2012, the population consisted of all addicts that referred to Shefa Drug Rehabilitation Center. A sample of 201 individuals was selected randomly. Two questionnaires were drawn up to collect data; the first questionnaire examined demographic characteristics and the second was the 71-item Minnesota Multiphase Personality Inventory short form. Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used in SPSS20 to analyze the data. RESULTS: Overall, 98% of participants were men, 65.7% were married, and 13.3% were unemployed. Depression and hypomania were respectively the most and the least prevalent disorders among individuals with high-risk psychological profiles of clinical scales respectively. Psychopathic deviation and schizophrenia were seen among the unemployed more than the employed ones. CONCLUSION: Considering the fact that depression was the most common personality disorder among the addicts participating, it is recommended that this disorder be given priority in investigations in the treatment programs of these patients. In addition, the scales of disorder, schizophrenia, mental infirmity, mental deviation, and paranoia had a significant relationship to aggression, delirium and hallucination, which must be taken into consideration in the treatment of such patients.

26055957|t|Hypertonic saline infusion in traumatic brain injury increases the incidence of pulmonary infection.
26055957|a|UNASSIGNED: We aimed to investigate the incidence of electrolyte abnormalities, acute kidney injury (AKI), deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and infections in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) treated with hypertonic saline (HTS) as osmolar therapy. We retrospectively studied 205 TBI patients, 96 with HTS and 109 without, admitted to the surgical/trauma intensive care unit between 2006 and 2012. Hemodynamics, electrolytes, length of stay (LOS), acute physiological assessment and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), injury severity scores (ISS) and mortality were tabulated. Infection, mechanical ventilation, DVT and AKI incidence were reviewed. HTS was associated with increased LOS and all infections (p=0.0001). After correction for the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and ventilator need, pulmonary infections (p=0.001) and LOS remained higher with HTS (p=0.0048). HTS did not result in increased blood pressure, DVT, AKI or neurological benefits. HTS significantly increased the odds for all infections, most specifically pulmonary infections, in patients with GCS<8. Due to these findings, HTS in TBI should be administered with caution regardless of acuity.

26009914|t|A Retrospective Study of Clinical and Radiologic Outcomes of 69 Consecutive Maxillary Sinus Augmentations Associated with Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery.
26009914|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this clinical investigation was to evaluate the clinical and radiologic outcomes of a single-step surgical procedure that includes functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) and maxillary sinus elevation by the lateral window approach in patients with reversible contraindications to sinus elevation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with insufficient bone height in the posterior maxilla caused by pneumatization of the sinus and with reversible ear-nose-throat (ENT) contraindications to sinus elevation were recruited for this investigation between January 2010 and January 2012. All patients were treated in a single session under general anesthesia for a total of 69 consecutive sinus augmentations. FESS was performed by an ENT specialist, and an oral surgeon carried out sinus elevation through the lateral window approach. Particulate xenograft was used beneath the sinus membrane. Intraoperative and postoperative complications (eg, membrane tears, rhinosinusitis, graft infection or loss) were reported. Nasal endoscopies were performed at 7, 14, and 30 days and 3 months after treatment. After a healing period of 6 months, 137 implants were inserted. Computed tomography scans were performed after 6 months and 1 year. RESULTS: Intraoperative membrane perforation occurred in only one case. No implant failures were recorded during the follow-up period. Radiologic and clinical findings showed the resolution of ENT disease and good bone graft integration after 1 year. A relapse of mucosal thickening observed in some patients did not influence the graft healing. CONCLUSION: Preliminary rhinosinusal evaluation by an ENT specialist and computed tomography of the ostiomeatal complex are necessary in patients needing maxillary sinus elevation. A single-step approach to FESS and sinus elevation is a predictable technique to manage patients with ENT reversible contraindications to sinus elevation.

26011206|t|Is the Male Gender an Independent Risk Factor for Complication in Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy for Acute Cholecystitis?
26011206|a|UNASSIGNED: This paper was designed to investigate the gender dependent risk of complication in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard procedure for benign gallbladder disorders. The role of gender as an independent risk factor for complicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains unclear. A retrospective single-center analysis of laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed for acute cholecystitis over a 5-year period in a community hospital was performed. Within the period of examination, 1884 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed. The diagnosis was acute cholecystitis in 779 cases (462 female, 317 male). The male group was significantly older (P = 0.001). Surgery lasted significantly longer in the male group (P = 0.008). Conversion was done in 35 cases (4.5%). There was no significant difference in the rate of conversion between both groups. However the rate of conversion was significantly higher in male patients > 65 years (P = 0.006). The length of postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in the male group (P = 0.007), in the group > 65 years (P = 0.001) and following conversion to open surgery (P = 0.001). The male gender was identified as an independent risk factor for prolonged laparoscopic cholecystectomy on multivariate analysis. The male gender could be an independent risk factor for complicated or challenging surgery in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis.

26010328|t|Lifestyle and weight predictors of a healthy overweight profile over a 20-year follow-up.
26010328|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine whether changes in modifiable risk factors [physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), body weight, and diet composition] are associated with the transition to metabolically healthy overweight/obese (MHOW) versus metabolically abnormal overweight/obese. METHODS: Analysis included 1,358 adults [aged 25.0 (3.5) years] from the CARDIA study who were healthy at baseline and had overweight/obesity at follow-up. Participants with zero or one of the following six risk factors were classified as MHOW: elevated triglycerides, LDL, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and HOMA-insulin resistance and low HDL. RESULTS: Over the 20-year follow-up, the sample gained weight (BMI 24.5 to 31.1 kg/m(2) ), and the prevalence of MHOW was 47% at follow-up. After adjusting for changes in CRF, diet, and weight change, physical activity and macronutrient intake were not independently associated with MHOW (P   >   0.05), while changes in CRF [fit-unfit: RR (95%)   =   0.58, 0.52-0.66; unfit-unfit: RR   =   0.67, 0.58-0.76, versus fit-fit] and weight [gain: RR (95%)   =   0.54, 0.43-0.67; cycle: RR   =   0.74, 0.57-0.94, versus stable] were independently associated with MHOW. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on high CRF and strategies to limit weight gain may be important for individuals with overweight and obesity in early to mid-adulthood to maintain a metabolically healthy profile.

26022131|t|Selection of a novel DNA thioaptamer against HER2 structure.
26022131|a|PURPOSE: Human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is over-expressed in several malignancies and represents an important therapeutic target. Aptamers are oligonucleotides that may potentially serve as tumor-homing ligand with excellent affinity and specificity for targeted cancer therapy. However, aptamers need to have nuclease resistance in order to function in vivo. The aim of this study was to generate a novel HER2 thioaptamer with enhanced nuclease resistance. METHODS: The HER2 thioaptamer is selected in an evolutionary process called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. RESULTS: The thioaptamer could bind to the extracellular domain of HER2 with a K d of 172 nM and had minimal cross reactivity to trypsin or IgG. Moreover, the thioaptamer was found capable of binding with the HER2-positive breast cancer cells SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-453, but not the HER2-negative cells MDA-MB-231. Notably, the thioaptamer HY6 largely maintained its structural integrity facing the nucleases in serum, while regular DNA aptamers were mostly digested. Additionally, the thioaptamer retained the capability of binding with the HER2-positive cells in the presence of serum, whereas non-thionated HER2 aptamer lost the binding function. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the selected thioaptamer was more resistant to nuclease than regular DNA aptamers and might potentially function as a HER2-targeting ligand in complicated environment.

26104183|t|Quenching of the upconversion luminescence of NaYF4:Yb(3+),Er(3+) and NaYF4:Yb(3+),Tm(3+) nanophosphors by water: the role of the sensitizer Yb(3+) in non-radiative relaxation.
26104183|a|UNASSIGNED: We have studied the mechanisms of water-based quenching of the upconversion photoluminescence of upconverting nanophosphors (UCNPs) via luminescence decay measurements for a better understanding of the non-radiative deactivation pathways responsible for the relatively low upconversion luminescence efficiency in aqueous solutions. This included both upconversion luminescence measurements and the direct excitation of emissive energy states of Er(3+) and Yb(3+) dopants in NaYF4:Yb(3+),Er(3+) UCNPs by measuring the decays at 550 and 655 nm upon 380 nm excitation and at 980 nm upon 930 nm excitation, respectively. The luminescence intensities and decays were measured from both bare and silanized NaYF4:Yb(3+),Er(3+) and NaYF4:Yb(3+),Tm(3+) UCNPs in H2O and D2O. The measurements revealed up to 99.9% quenching of the upconversion photoluminescence intensity of both Er(3+) and Tm(3+) doped bare nanophosphors by water. Instead of the multiphonon relaxation of excited energy levels of the activators, the main mechanism of quenching was found to be the multiphonon deactivation of the Yb(3+) sensitizer ion caused by OH-vibrations on the surface of the nanophosphor. Due to the nonlinear nature of upconversion, the quenching of Yb(3+) has a higher order effect on the upconversion emission intensity with the efficient Yb-Yb energy migration in the    35 nm nanocrystals making the whole nanophosphor volume susceptible to surface quenching effects. The study underlines the need of efficient surface passivation for the use of UCNPs as labels in bioanalytical applications performed in aqueous solutions.

26104467|t|Histone modifications predispose genome regions to breakage and translocation.
26104467|a|UNASSIGNED: Chromosome translocations are well-established hallmarks of cancer cells and often occur at nonrandom sites in the genome. The molecular features that define recurrent chromosome breakpoints are largely unknown. Using a combination of bioinformatics, biochemical analysis, and cell-based assays, we indentify here specific histone modifications as facilitators of chromosome breakage and translocations. We show enrichment of several histone modifications over clinically relevant translocation-prone genome regions. Experimental modulation of histone marks sensitizes genome regions to breakage by endonuclease challenge or irradiation and promotes formation of chromosome translocations of endogenous gene loci. Our results demonstrate that histone modifications predispose genome regions to chromosome breakage and translocations.

26107090|a|UNASSIGNED: Vinylidene is a high-energy isomer of acetylene, and the rearrangement of bonds in the two species serves as a prototype for isomerization reactions. Here, a full-dimensional quantum mechanical study of the vinylidene vibration is carried out on a recently developed global acetylene-vinylidene potential energy surface by simulating the photodetachment dynamics of the vinylidene anion. Several low-lying vibrational levels of the anion were first determined on a new ab initio based potential energy surface and their photoelectron spectra were obtained within the Condon approximation. The vibrational features of the vinylidene isomer are found to agree well with experiment in both positions and intensities, validating the global acetylene-vinylidene potential energy surface.

Key findings show that community pharmacists are more directed toward business than patients. They almost dispense all categories of medicines over-the-counter without the need of prescriptions. However, a new trend of pharmacists in Dubai is to provide enhanced pharmacy services such as consultation to patients upon request.

26104882|t|Physicochemical stability profile of Tulane virus -A human norovirus surrogate.
26104882|a|AIMS: Human norovirus (HuNoV) is estimated to cause 19 to 21 million illnesses each year in the U.S. A major limitation in HuNoV research is the lack of an in vitro culture system; therefore, surrogate viruses including murine norovirus (MNV) and feline calicivirus (FCV) are used to study HuNoV. Here we aim to establish the physiochemical properties of Tulane virus (TV)-a newer HuNoV surrogate. METHODS AND RESULTS: For thermal inactivation, TV was exposed to 37  C for 2h, and 56, 63, and 72  C for 30 min. For ethanol tolerance, TV was treated with 60, 70, and 90% ethanol at room temperature (RT) for 5 min. Tulane virus pH stability at pH 2, 3, 7, 9, and 10 was performed at RT for 90 min. At 37  C, there was no significant reduction of TV after 2 h. However, at 56, 63, and 72  C, D-values of 1.71, 1.29, and 1.25 min, were calculated, respectively. The D-values obtained for TV ethanol tolerance were 1.78, 2.42, and 0.31 min at 60, 70, and 90%, respectively. Less than 1 log10 plaque forming units (PFU) reduction was observed for TV at all pH levels except pH 10 where about a 2-log10 PFU reduction was observed. Tulane virus was also tolerant to chlorine disinfection on a solid surface with D-values of 15.82 and 5.42 min at 200 and 1000ppm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Tulane virus is likely a suitable surrogate to study HuNoV thermal stability as well as ethanol tolerance below 90%. Tulane virus also is a promising surrogate to study HuNoV pH stability and chlorine tolerance. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT: Based on current work, in vitro studies demonstrate that TV is an overall more conservative and suitable surrogate for the study of HuNoV physicochemical properties This article is protected by copyright.

26116088|t|Interferon a: A potentially effective treatment for minimal residual disease in acute leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
26116088|a|UNASSIGNED: The safety and efficacy of preemptive interferon-a (IFN-a) treatment were investigated and compared with preemptive donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in patients who were minimal residual disease (MRD) positive after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in this prospective clinical study. Patients receiving allogeneic HSCT were eligible if they had acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome and were MRD positive after HSCT. Patients who were able to receive DLI were assigned to a preemptive DLI group (n=45); patients who could not or did not agree to receive DLI after HSCT received preemptive IFN-a. A total of 22 patients received preemptive IFN-a; the median treatment duration was 35 days (4-180 days). Seven patients relapsed and 1 died from severe pneumonia. The 1-year cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after intervention was 90.9% and 62.9% in the IFN-a and DLI groups, respectively (P<0.001). MRD status after preemptive intervention was comparable between IFN-a and DLI groups, and the 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse after intervention was 27.3% and 35.6%, respectively (P=0.514). The 1-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) after intervention in the IFN-a and DLI groups was 4.5% and 4.4%, respectively (P=0.985). The 1-year probabilities of disease-free survival (DFS) after intervention were 68.2% and 60.0% for patients in the IFN-a and DLI groups, respectively (P=0.517). In multivariate analysis, early-onset MRD, persistent MRD after intervention, and non-cGVHD after intervention were significantly associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Thus, preemptive IFN-a may be a potential alternative for MRD-positive patients who could not receive preemptive DLI after HSCT.

26116530|t|An integrated RNA-Seq and network study reveals a complex regulation process of rice embryo during seed germination.
26116530|a|UNASSIGNED: Seed germination is a crucial stage for plant development and agricultural production. To investigate its complex regulation process, the RNA-Seq study of rice embryo was conducted at three time points of 0, 12 and 48 h post imbibition (HPI). Dynamic transcriptional alterations were observed, especially in the early stage (0-12 HPI). Seed related genes, especially those encoding desiccation inducible proteins and storage reserves in embryo, decreased drastically after imbibition. The expression profiles of phytohormone related genes indicated distinct roles of abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA) and brassinosteroid (BR) in germination. Moreover, network analysis revealed the importance of protein phosphorylation in phytohormone interactions. Network and gene ontology (GO) analyses suggested that transcription factors (TFs) played a regulatory role in functional transitions during germination, and the enriched TF families at 0 HPI implied a regulation of epigenetic modification in dry seeds. In addition, 35 germination-specific TF genes in embryo were identified and seven genes were verified by qRT-PCR. Besides, enriched TF binding sites (TFBSs) supported physiological changes in germination. Overall, this study expands our comprehensive knowledge of multiple regulation factors underlying rice seed germination.

26115978|t|The efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer: A randomized multicenter study.
26115978|a|OBJECTIVE: This study sought to evaluate the toxicity and curative effect of irinotecan plus cisplatin neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for stage Ib2, IIa, and IIb cervical cancer. METHODS: A total of 219 patients were randomly assigned to two groups: 109 patients were treated with 1-2 cycles of chemotherapy (NACT group), and 110 patients in the control group were treated directly with surgery (DS group). Patients in the NACT group were randomly assigned to two groups: 50 patients were treated with irinotecan plus cisplatin followed by surgery (IP group), and 59 patients were treated with paclitaxel plus cisplatin followed by surgery (TP group). Patients with pathological recurrence risk factors received post-operative radiotherapy. RESULTS: Survival analysis revealed no significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) between the NACT and DS groups. Analysis of clinicopathologic factors showed that the lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) and deep stromal invasion rates were significantly lower in the NACT group. Grade 3/4 neutropenia and grade 3/4 diarrhea were both higher in the IP group than in the TP group. DFS and OS were similar in the IP and TP groups. Univariate analysis showed that LVSI was the only factor associated with DFS. CONCLUSION: NACT did not improve overall survival but did reduce the number of patients who received post-operative radiotherapy. NACT consisting of irinotecan plus cisplatin for cervical cancer showed similar efficacy and higher toxicity compared with the use of paclitaxel plus cisplatin, although the toxicity was tolerable.

26049118|t|Chameleon 'aggregation-prone' segments of apoA-I: A model of amyloid fibrils formed in apoA-I amyloidosis.
26049118|a|UNASSIGNED: Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the major component of high density lipoproteins and plays a vital role in reverse cholesterol transport. Lipid-free apoA-I is the main constituent of amyloid deposits found in atherosclerotic plaques, an acquired type of amyloidosis, whereas its N-terminal fragments have been associated with a hereditary form, known as familial apoA-I amyloidosis. Here, we identified and verified four "aggregation-prone" segments of apoA-I with amyloidogenic properties, utilizing electron microscopy, X-ray fiber diffraction, ATR FT-IR spectroscopy and polarized light microscopy. These segments may act as conformational switches, possibly controlling the transition of the a-helical apoA-I content into the "cross-b" architecture of amyloid fibrils. A structural model illuminating the structure of amyloid fibrils formed by the N-terminal fragments of apoA-I is proposed, indicating that two of the identified chameleon segments may play a vital part in the formation of amyloid fibrils in familial apoA-I amyloidosis.

26095804|t|Transcriptome profiling of the eyestalk of precocious juvenile Chinese mitten crab reveals putative neuropeptides and differentially expressed genes.
26095804|a|UNASSIGNED: Chinese mitten crabs that reach maturity 1year earlier than normal crabs are known as precocious juvenile crabs. The molecular mechanisms underlying the precocity of the Chinese mitten crab are poorly understood. To identify the genes that may be involved in the control of precocity in Chinese mitten crab, we measured the expression profile of eyestalk genes in precocious and normally developed juvenile crabs using high-throughput sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. We obtained 56,446,284 raw reads from the precocious crabs and 58,029,476 raw reads from the normally developed juvenile crabs. Reads from the two libraries were combined into a single data set. De novo assembly of the combined read set yielded 78,777 unigenes with an average length of 1563bp. A total of 41,405 unigenes with predicted ORFs were selected for functional annotation. Among these genes, we identified three neuropeptide genes belonging to the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone family and two neuropeptide genes encoding the chromatophorotropic hormones. Transcriptome comparison between the two libraries revealed 42 genes that exhibited significant differential expression, of which 29 genes were up-regulated and 13 genes were down-regulated in the precocious crabs. To confirm the sequencing data, six differentially expressed genes with functional annotations were selected and validated by qRT-PCR. In conclusion, we obtained the comprehensive transcriptome of the eyestalk tissues of precocious juvenile crabs. The sequencing results may provide new insights into the biomolecular basis of precocity in the Chinese mitten crab.

26117217|t|Factors associated with interhospital transfer of children with respiratory failure from level II to level I pediatric intensive care units.
26117217|a|PURPOSE: Of all sources of admission to level I pediatric intensive care units (PICUs), interhospital transfer admissions from level II PICUs carry the highest mortality and resource use burden. We sought to investigate factors associated with transfer of children with respiratory failure from level II to level I PICUs. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted among children with respiratory failure admitted to 6 level II PICUs between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2007, with frequency matching of 466 nontransferred children (controls) to 187 transferred children (cases). RESULTS: Among 653 children, transferred children were younger and had more comorbidities. After multivariable analysis, transferred children were more likely to have comorbidities (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-2.98) and receive escalated care including high-frequency ventilation (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.04-6.37) and surfactant therapy (OR, 5.33; 95% CI, 1.35-21.0). CONCLUSIONS: The study identified patient-level and process-of-care factors associated with transfer from level II to level I PICUs. These findings highlight the influence of escalated care on transfer decision making for critically ill children in respiratory failure.

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with once-daily blinded UMEC 62.5   g (delivering 55   g), UMEC 125   g (delivering 113   g) or placebo (PBO) added to open-label FF/VI (delivering 92/22   g; N  =  1238 [intent-to-treat population]). The primary endpoint was trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) on Day 85; the secondary endpoint was 0-6  h post-dose weighted mean (WM) FEV1 at Day 84. Health-related quality of life was reported using St George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ). Adverse events (AEs) were also assessed. RESULTS: In both studies, trough FEV1 was significantly improved with UMEC  +  FF/VI (62.5   g and 125   g) versus PBO  +  FF/VI (range: 0.111-0.128  L, all p  <  0.001 [Day 85]), as was 0-6  h post-dose WM FEV1 (range: 0.135-0.153  L, all p  <  0.001 [Day 84]). SGRQ results were inconsistent, with statistically significant improvements with UMEC  +  FF/VI versus PBO  +  FF/VI in one study only and with UMEC 62.5   g only (difference in SGRQ total score from baseline between treatments:  -2.16, p  <  0.05). Across all treatment groups, the overall incidences of AEs were similar (30-39%), as were cardiovascular AEs of special interest (<1-3%) and pneumonia AEs (0-1%). CONCLUSION: Overall, the addition of UMEC to FF/VI therapy resulted in significant improvements in lung function compared with PBO  +  FF/VI in patients with COPD, with similar safety profiles, though SGRQ results were inconsistent. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results from these two studies demonstrate that the addition of umeclidinium (62.5   g and 125   g) to FF/VI (100/25   g) provides statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in lung function compared with placebo  +  FF/VI in patients with COPD. Statistically significant improvements in quality of life with UMEC  +  FF/VI versus placebo  +  FF/VI were reported in one study only. Safety profiles were consistent across all treatment groups in both studies. These studies support the use of triple therapy in COPD, providing physicians with an alternative treatment option.

26117734|t|Four-order stiffness variation of laser-fabricated photopolymer biodegradable scaffolds by laser parameter modulation.
26117734|a|UNASSIGNED: The effects of various fabrication parameters of our Mask Projection Excimer Laser StereoLithography (MPExSL) system were investigated. We demonstrate that laser parameters directly change the physical properties (stiffness, thermal degradation, and height/thickness) of the poly(propylene fumarate) (PFF) scaffold structures. The tested parameters were the number of pulses, fluence per pulse and laser repetition rate. We present a four-order tuning capability of MPExSL-fabricated structures' stiffness without altering the resin composition or using cumbersome post-treatment procedures. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry confirmed this tuning capability. Prototype-segmented scaffold designs are presented and analyzed to further expand the concept and exploit this in situ stiffness tuning capability of the scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.

26114428|t|Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Response and Resistance to Cold Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Is Linked to the Redox-Active Molecule Phenazine.
26114428|a|UNASSIGNED: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen displaying high antibiotic resistance. Its resistance is in part due to its outstanding ability to form biofilms on a range of biotic and abiotic surfaces leading to difficult-to-treat, often long-term infections. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a new, promising antibacterial treatment to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Plasma is ionized gas that has antibacterial properties through the generation of a mix of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), excited molecules, charged particles and UV photons. Our results show the efficient removal of P. aeruginosa biofilms using a plasma jet (kINPen med), with no viable cells detected after 5 min treatment and no attached biofilm cells visible with confocal microscopy after 10 min plasma treatment. Because of its multi-factorial action, it is widely presumed that the development of bacterial resistance to plasma is unlikely. However, our results indicate that a short plasma treatment (3 min) may lead to the emergence of a small number of surviving cells exhibiting enhanced resistance to subsequent plasma exposure. Interestingly, these cells also exhibited a higher degree of resistance to hydrogen peroxide. Whole genome comparison between surviving cells and control cells revealed 10 distinct polymorphic regions, including four belonging to the redox active, antibiotic pigment phenazine. Subsequently, the interaction between phenazine production and CAP resistance was demonstrated in biofilms of transposon mutants disrupted in different phenazine pathway genes which exhibited significantly altered sensitivity to CAP.

26115338|t|Salt in the wound: The interfering effect of road salt on acidified forest catchments.
26115338|a|UNASSIGNED: Atmospheric acidic depositions have strongly altered the functioning and biodiversity of Central European forest ecosystems. Most impacts occurred until the end of the 20(th) century but the situation substantially improved thereafter caused by legal regulations in the late 1980's to reduce acidifying atmospheric pollution. Since then slow recovery from acidification has been observed in forested catchments and adjacent waters. However, trends of recovery are inconsistent and underlying mechanisms diminishing recovery are still poorly understood. We propose that the input of road salt can significantly affect acidity regime and acidification recovery of forest ecosystems. By comparing the discharge hydro-chemistry and plant community composition of springs fed by forested catchments with and without high levels of salt input over two decades we observed a significant suppression of recovery and elevated levels of nutrient leaching (K(+), Ca(2+) and Mg(2+)) in highly salt contaminated catchments. We show that the pollution of near-surface groundwater (interflow) by road salt application can have lasting effects on ecosystem processes over distances of several hundred metres apart from the salt emitting road.

26114563|t|[Intraoperative Evaluation of Total Knee Arthroplasty: Anatomic and Kinematic Assessment with Trial Components].
26114563|a|UNASSIGNED: The intraoperative use of trial components in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is of paramount importance to prevent inadequate ligament balance and to achieve optimal position of the definitive components. This review demonstrates an 8-step algorithm to assess the anatomy of the femoral, tibial and patellar component as well as the kinematics of the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints. Trial components allow an easy assessment of the anatomic fit of the final implants. Upon the trials insertion, bone coverage and the component overhang should be evaluated. The femoral rotation should be assessed using the transepicondylar axis and for the tibial component rotation assessment, the tibial tuberosity would be the most reliable bony landmark. Addressing the patella, sizing and bone coverage should be thoroughly evaluated. In order to restore physiological kinematics the remnants of the meniscus rim can be used to determine the correct reconstruction of the joint line. A tight extension gap results in limited extension, whereas a tight or unbalanced flexion gap leads to "booking" or "spin-out" of the inlay. The POLO test (pull-out, lift- off) allows an easy assessment of the posterior cruciate ligament tension and the size of the flexion gap as well. To prevent postoperative dislocation and overstuffing, specific tests for correct patellar positioning and tracking support should be performed. The anatomy and kinematics of total knee arthroplasty have to be evaluated by trial components on a routine basis before inserting the final implants in order to identify implant positioning errors and inadequate ligament balance.

26114000|t|Xanthogranulomatous Salpingooophoritis: The Youngest Documented Case Report.
26114000|a|Background. Xanthogranulomatous inflammation is an uncommon affection of the female genital tract. The youngest case reported of xanthogranulomatous salpingooophoritis in literature was by Shilpa et al. in 2013 in an eighteen-year-old female. Case Report. We report a case of 2-year-old female child with right-sided xanthogranulomatous salpingooophoritis presented as mass in abdomen. This is a case report of the youngest documented case of xanthogranulomatous salpingooophoritis in literature. As per abdominal examination, there was generalized distention of abdomen and a mass was palpable which was arising out of pelvis more on the right side. The ultrasonography (USG) abdomen and pelvis revealed a thick-walled mass measuring 9.2   cm * 6.0   cm * 7.6   cm in pelvis. We did right salpingooophorectomy of the patient. On histopathology, the diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous salpingooophoritis was confirmed. Conclusion. Clinical presentation, radiological appearance, and gross features of xanthogranulomatous lesions of ovary can mimic neoplastic lesions and lead to misdiagnosis. Though, it is very rare in pediatric age group, xanthogranulomatous salpingooophoritis as one of the differential diagnoses should be kept in mind while dealing with tuboovarian masses in this age group.

26120793|t|Seasonal Variability in Vitamin D Levels No Longer Detectable in Primary Hyperparathyroidism.
26120793|a|CONTEXT: Seasonal variability in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the general population has been associated with differences in bone turnover markers, bone density and fracture risk. Seasonal variability in 25OHD and PTH levels has also been reported in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). OBJECTIVE: Given the widespread use of vitamin D supplements, we sought to determine whether patients with PHPT still demonstrated seasonal variation in 25OHD levels. DESIGN AND SETTING: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a university medical center at a Northeastern US latitude (New York City, NY). PATIENTS: 100 PHPT patients participated in the study. OUTCOME: measures: We assessed vitamin D supplement use and seasonal variation in serum 25OHD. RESULTS: Patients had PHPT ([mean    SD] calcium: 10.8    1.0 mg/dl; PTH: 85    48 pg/ml) with a mean 25OHD level of 29    10 ng/ml. While only one-fifth of participants had vitamin D deficiency (19% < 20 ng/ml), more than half were either deficient or insufficient (54% < 30 ng/ml). Sun exposure varied by season, but there were no seasonal differences in levels of 25OHD, PTH, bone markers or BMD, or in the prevalence of 25OHD <20 or <30 ng/ml. Most (65%) of the participants took supplemental vitamin D (dose among users: mean 1643    1496 IU; median1000 IU daily), and supplement users had markedly better vitamin D status than non-users (25OHD<20 ng/ml: 8% vs. 40%, p<0.0001; <30 ng/ml: 40% vs. 80%, p=0.0001; >= 30 ng/ml: 60% vs. 20%, p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of seasonal variation in 25OHD levels or PHPT disease severity in the Northeastern US. This change is likely due to widespread high vitamin D supplement intake, which has resulted in better vitamin D status among supplement users and can mask the effect of season on serum 25OHD levels.

26002688|t|Cochlear neuropathy in human presbycusis: Confocal analysis of hidden hearing loss in post-mortem tissue.
26002688|a|UNASSIGNED: Recent animal work has suggested that cochlear synapses are more vulnerable than hair cells in both noise-induced and age-related hearing loss. This synaptopathy is invisible in conventional histopathological analysis, because cochlear nerve cell bodies in the spiral ganglion survive for years, and synaptic analysis requires special immunostaining or serial-section electron microscopy. Here, we show that the same quadruple-immunostaining protocols that allow synaptic counts, hair cell counts, neuronal counts and differentiation of afferent and efferent fibers in mouse can be applied to human temporal bones, when harvested within 9  h post-mortem and prepared as dissected whole mounts of the sensory epithelium and osseous spiral lamina. Quantitative analysis of five "normal" ears, aged 54-89  yrs, without any history of otologic disease, suggests that cochlear synaptopathy and the degeneration of cochlear nerve peripheral axons, despite a near-normal hair cell population, may be an important component of human presbycusis. Although primary cochlear nerve degeneration is not expected to affect audiometric thresholds, it may be key to problems with hearing in noise that are characteristic of declining hearing abilities in the aging ear.

26119056|a|UNASSIGNED: Thaumetopoea pityocampa causes allergies and skin and ocular lesions. No commercial tools are currently available for the clinical diagnosis of this allergy. We aimed to develop an in vitro method for the diagnosis of this allergy to avoid patients undergoing in vivo tests with insect extracts. Recombinant Tha p 2 was produced and used in an ELISA validated with 15 allergic patients. Subsequently, 42 subjects recruited from a random sampling cross-sectional study were analysed. The ELISA sensitivity and specificity were 93.3% and 100%, respectively, for the allergic patients and 71.4% and 95.3%, respectively, for the epidemiological study. The positive ELISA results correlated with the skin prick test areas with the whole body and the setae extracts. Professional exposure and short latency of symptoms onset were risk factors for a positive result in the ELISA. In conclusion, our ELISA is very useful for T. pityocampa allergy diagnosis and for epidemiologic testing. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

26117898|a|Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a widely used material element detection technology. Because of its detection result is affected by many factors, and therefore, analysing and comparising the different experimental conditions have important significance for LIBS. Experimental sample produced by Beichuan County, Sichuan Province, China, which is ordinary Portland cement P. O42.5, using eight-channel fiber optic spectrometer AvaSpec-2048-USB2-RM, delay trigger DG645 for LIBS testing. Several metallic elements as Mg, Al, Na, K, which affect cement's technical indicators were analyzed. Mainly compares the effect of laser frequency, the same point measurement times on different metal element spectral signal intensity, the optimum experimental parameters under the condition of this experiment: 10 Hz was the best laser frequency. When laser frequency is 10 Hz, the spectrum intensity of elements Mg, Al, Na, K were increased by 67.66%, 47.88%, 84.59%, 43.36% than 8 Hz. Because the tablet samples in place, the surface will have a small amount of oxidation and deliquescence, in order to measure 10 times for an average income results were recorded under the condition, with third, four records of results for the best.

26119259|a|UNASSIGNED: Epidural blood patching is an effective treatment for postdural puncture headache but has potential risks. Arachnoiditis is a very rare disabling condition and few cases have been described following an epidural blood patch. We present a case of chronic adhesive arachnoiditis in a parturient treated with a repeat epidural blood patch. A healthy 29-year-old woman had an accidental dural puncture following epidural insertion during labour. Initial treatment of postdural puncture headache with an epidural blood patch was ineffective and was therefore repeated. She gradually developed severe neurological symptoms consistent with arachnoiditis confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging. Despite intensive multimodal treatment with analgesics and physiotherapy, her neurological condition remains unresolved two years later. This serious but rare complication should encourage caution when treating parturients with postdural puncture headache with a repeat epidural blood patch.

26102841|t|4A.05: CIRCULATING FGF-23 AS AN INDEPENDENT CORRELATE OF HYPERTENSION AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS IN EARLY STAGES OF CKD.
26102841|a|OBJECTIVE: Clinical and experimental evidence support a role for fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23) in promoting osteoclastic bone resorption, but the precise molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. FGF-23 has been implicated in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is important in humans for osteogenesis. However, to date the possible role of FGF-23 in secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHP) is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the serum levels of FGF-23 and its potential correlation with blood pressure, atherosclerotic markers and albuminuria in patients with early stages of CKD. DESIGN AND METHOD: CKD patients (n=50) of stages 1 and 2 with type 2 diabetic nephropathy (DN, n=25) and chronic glomerulonephritis, (CG, n=25) were included. As controls, there were two groups, patients with diabetes type 2 without CKD (n=40) and healthy individuals (n=40). FGF-23 levels were measured by an ELISA method. Blood pressure (BP) was taken using a manual sphygmomanometer. Intima media thickness (IMT) of carotid arteries as a sub-atherosclerotic marker and presence of atherosclerotic plaque were evaluated by a high resolution ultrasonography. Statistical analysis was performed with the use of a SPSS system. RESULTS: The levels of FGF-23 were significantly higher in patients than in the control groups (0.5  0.1, p<0.004). IMT was also significantly higher in patients than in the control groups (0.35  0.15, p<0.001) and albuminuria (300  150, p<0.0001). There was negative strong correlation between FGF-23 and GFR (r=-0.75, p<0.005), and positive strong correlation between FGF-23 and BP (0.7, p<0.0001), between FGF-23 and IMT (r=0.85, p<0.0001) and FGF-23 and albuminuria (r=0.75, p<0.0001). Further, FGF-23 levels were independent correlates of BP, IMT and albuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that serum levels of FGF-23 were strongly correlated with BP, IMT, atheromatic plaque as well as with albuminuria, attributing a role for FGF-23 in atherosclerosis of CKD patients. FGF-23 might present an independent correlate of atherosclerosis in early stages of CKD.

26100901|t|Structural insights into the recognition of cisplatin and AAF-dG lesion by Rad14 (XPA).
26100901|a|UNASSIGNED: Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is responsible for the removal of a large variety of structurally diverse DNA lesions. Mutations of the involved proteins cause the xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) cancer predisposition syndrome. Although the general mechanism of the NER process is well studied, the function of the XPA protein, which is of central importance for successful NER, has remained enigmatic. It is known, that XPA binds kinked DNA structures and that it interacts also with DNA duplexes containing certain lesions, but the mechanism of interactions is unknown. Here we present two crystal structures of the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the yeast XPA homolog Rad14 bound to DNA with either a cisplatin lesion (1,2-GG) or an acetylaminofluorene adduct (AAF-dG). In the structures, we see that two Rad14 molecules bind to the duplex, which induces DNA melting of the duplex remote from the lesion. Each monomer interrogates the duplex with a b-hairpin, which creates a 13mer duplex recognition motif additionally characterized by a sharp 70   DNA kink at the position of the lesion. Although the 1,2-GG lesion stabilizes the kink due to the covalent fixation of the crosslinked dG bases at a 90   angle, the AAF-dG fully intercalates into the duplex to stabilize the kinked structure.

26101699|t|Mogrol represents a novel leukemia therapeutic, via ERK and STAT3 inhibition.
26101699|a|Unlike solid tumors, the primary strategy for leukemia treatment is chemotherapy. However, leukemia chemotherapy is associated with adverse drug effects and drug resistance. Therefore, it is imperative to identify novel agents that effectively treat leukemia while minimizing adverse effects. The Raf/MEK/extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways have been implicated in leukemia carcinogenesis, and provide novel molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Mogrol, a biometabolite of mogrosides found in Siraitia grosvenorii, has exhibited anti-cancer activities; however, the underlying mechanism of this effect remains unclear. To clarify its anti-cancer activity and mechanism of action, we treated K562 leukemia cells with mogrol. Mogrol suppressed leukemia cell growth via inhibition of the ERK1/2 and STAT3 pathways, in particular, through the suppression of p-ERK1/2 and p-STAT3. Inhibition of these pathways suppressed Bcl-2 expression, thereby inducing K562 cell apoptosis. Furthermore, mogrol enhanced p21 expression, resulting in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. The findings provide new perspectives regarding the role of mogrol in leukemia treatment.

26100281|t|Neurotrophin propeptides: biological functions and molecular mechanisms.
26100281|a|UNASSIGNED: Neurotrophins constitute a family of growth factors that play a key role in the regulation of the development and function of the central and peripheral nervous systems. A common feature of all the neurotrophins is their synthesis in cells as long precursors (pre-pro-neurotrophins) that contain an N-terminal signal peptide, a following propeptide and the mature neurotrophin. Although the signal peptide functions have been well studied, the role of neurotrophin propeptides is not so clear. Here, we briefly summarize the biochemistry of neurotrophin propeptides, including their role as folding-assistants for the mature factor and their role in processing and in secretion of neurotrophins. In the main part of the review we summarize our current state of knowledge of the biological activity of neurotrophin propeptides, their possible mechanisms of action, and their potential influence on the activity of the mature neurotrophins.

26112072|t|The TatC component of the twin-arginine protein translocase functions as an obligate oligomer.
26112072|a|UNASSIGNED: The Tat protein export system translocates folded proteins across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and the plant thylakoid membrane. The Tat system in Escherichia coli is comprised of TatA, TatB and TatC proteins. TatB and TatC form an oligomeric, multivalent receptor complex that binds Tat substrates, while multiple protomers of TatA assemble at substrate-bound TatBC receptors to facilitate substrate transport. We have addressed whether oligomerisation of TatC is an absolute requirement for operation of the Tat pathway by screening for dominant negative alleles of tatC that inactivate Tat function in the presence of wild type tatC. Single substitutions that confer dominant negative TatC activity localised to the periplasmic cap region. The variant TatC proteins retained the ability to interact with TatB and with a Tat substrate but were unable to support the in vivo assembly of TatA complexes. Blue-native PAGE analysis showed that the variant TatC proteins produced smaller TatBC complexes than the wild type TatC protein. The substitutions did not alter disulphide crosslinking to neighbouring TatC molecules from positions in the periplasmic cap but abolished a substrate-induced disulphide crosslink in transmembrane helix five of TatC. Our findings show that TatC functions as an obligate oligomer.

26115069|t|Effects of intensive lipid-lowering therapy on coronary plaques composition in patients with acute myocardial infarction: Assessment with serial coronary CT angiography.
26115069|a|BACKGROUND: Statins have been shown to possess favourable effects on the cardiovascular system with stabilization of the vulnerable plaque. We sought to assess the effects of early aggressive statin treatment on plaque composition in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), using serial assessment with coronary CT-angiography (CTA). METHODS: In a prospective randomized blinded endpoint trial patients with AMI were randomized to an intensive lipid lowering treatment receiving statin loading with 80  mg rosuvastatin followed by 40  mg daily or standard statin therapy according to current guidelines. Patients were assessed with CTA at baseline and after 12 months with evaluation of plaque volume and composition. RESULTS: In total, 140 patients with AMI were randomized and plaque composition was assessed in 96 patients. In the intensive care group LDL-level was median 1.3 [0.9; 1.5] mmol/l at 12 months follow-up and 2.0 [1.7; 2.4] mmol/l in the usual care group, p  <  0.001. Plaque volume increased over 12 months with 43.5 (  225.8) mm(3) in the intensive care group and 19.1 (  190.2) mm(3) in the usual care group, p  =  0.57. Plaque composition changed over 12 months with an increase in total dense calcium volume by 11.1 (  39.6) mm(3), corresponding to a 23% increase, in the intensive care group and a decreased by  -0.4 (  26.6) mm(3) in the usual care group, p  <  0.001. Necrotic core volume increased 26.8 (  122.1) mm(3) in the intensive care group and 25.2 (  80.1) mm(3) in the usual care group, p  =  0.94. CONCLUSIONS: Early aggressive lipid lowering therapy significantly increases dense calcium volume in patients with AMI.

26052078|t|Review of the use of botanicals for epilepsy in complementary medical systems - Traditional Chinese Medicine.
26052078|a|UNASSIGNED: In traditional Chinese medicine, botanical remedies have been used for centuries to treat seizures. This review aimed to summarize the botanicals that have been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat epilepsy. We searched Chinese online databases to determine the botanicals used for epilepsy in traditional Chinese medicine and identified articles using a preset search syntax and inclusion criteria of each botanical in the PubMed database to explore their potential mechanisms. Twenty-three botanicals were identified to treat epilepsy in traditional Chinese medicine. The pharmacological mechanisms of each botanical related to antiepileptic activity, which were mainly examined in animal models, were reviewed. We discuss the use and current trends of botanical treatments in China and highlight the limitations of botanical epilepsy treatments. A substantial number of these types of botanicals would be good candidates for the development of novel AEDs. More rigorous clinical trials of botanicals in traditional Chinese medicine for epilepsy treatment are encouraged in the future. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "Botanicals for Epilepsy".

26079626|t|Association between ovarian stimulators with or without intrauterine insemination, and assisted reproductive technologies on multiple births.
26079626|a|OBJECTIVE: To quantify the risk of multiple births associated with the use of different modalities of medically assisted reproduction. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a case-control study using a birth cohort between 2006 and 2009. This cohort was built with the linkage of data obtained by a self-administered questionnaire and medical, hospital, pharmaceutical, birth, and death databases in Quebec. Cases were pregnancies resulting in multiple live births (ICD-9/ICD-10 codes). Each case was matched, on maternal age and year of delivery, with three singleton pregnancies (controls) randomly selected among all Quebec's singletons pregnancies. Data on the use of different fertility treatments was collected by a self-administrated questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression models, adjusted for BMI, number of previous live births, ethnicity, family income, place of residence, marital status, subfertility, reduction of embryos, diabetes, metformin treatment, folic acid supplementation, and lifestyle factors, were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs). We evaluated the associations between each type of fertility treatment (ovarian stimulators used alone, intrauterine insemination used with ovarian stimulation, and assisted reproductive technologies) and the risk of multiple births. RESULTS: A total of 1407 cases of multiple births and 3580 controls were analyzed. More than half of multiple births following medically assisted reproduction (53.6%) occurred among women having used ovarian stimulation with or without intrauterine insemination. The use of ovarian stimulators alone and intrauterine insemination with ovarian stimulation increase the risk of multiple births (adjusted OR, 4.5; 95% CI, and 3.2 -6.4) ; adjusted OR, 9.32; 95% CI, 5.60- 15.50, respectively) compared to spontaneous conception. The use of invasive assisted reproductive technologies was associated with a greatly increased risk of multiple births. Among only the 465 women who used medically assisted reproduction for conception, the use of intrauterine insemination with ovarian stimulation was associated with an increased risk of multiple births (adjusted OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.12-3.49) when compared to ovarian stimulators used alone. Invasive assisted reproductive technologies were associated with an increased risk of multiple births (adjusted OR, 6.81; 95% CI, 3.72-12.49) when compared to ovarian stimulators used alone. CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk of multiple births associated with invasive assisted reproductive technologies can be decreased by elective implementing single embryo transfer, a special attention should be paid to the greatly increased risk associated with ovarian stimulation used alone or with intrauterine insemination.

26084663|t|Development of a multiplex fluorescence immunological assay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against Cooperia oncophora, Dictyocaulus viviparus and Fasciola hepatica in cattle.
26084663|a|BACKGROUND: A major constraint for the effective control and management of helminth parasites is the lack of rapid, high-throughput, routine diagnostic tests to assess the health status of individual animals and herds and to identify the parasite species responsible for these helminthoses. The capability of a multiplex platform for the simultaneous detection of three pasture associated parasite species was evaluated and compared to existing ELISAs. METHODS: The recombinant antigens 14.2  kDa ES protein for Cooperia oncophora, major sperm protein for Dictyocaulus viviparus and Cathepsin L1 for Fasciola hepatica were recombinantly expressed either in Escherichia coli or Pichia pastoris. Antigens were covalently coupled onto magnetic beads. Optimal concentrations for coupling were determined following the examination of serum samples collected from experimentally mono-infected animals, before and after their infection with the target species. Absence of cross-reactivity was further determined with sera from calves mono-infected with Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia ostertagi and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Examination of negative serum samples was characterised by low median fluorescence intensity (MFI). RESULTS: Establishment of the optimal serum dilution of 1:200 was achieved for all three bead sets. Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses were performed to obtain cut-off MFI values for each parasite separately. Sensitivity and specificity at the chosen cut-off values were close to, or 100  % for all bead sets. Examination of serum samples collected on different days post infection from different animals showed a high reproducibility of the assays. Serum samples were additionally examined with two already established ELISAs, an in-house ELISA using the recombinant MSP as an antigen and a DRG ELISA using Cathepsin L1 for liver fluke. The results between the assays were compared and kappa tests revealed an overall good agreement. CONCLUSIONS: A versatile bead-based assay using fluorescence detection (xMAP   technology) was developed to simultaneously detect antibodies against C. oncophora, D. viviparus and F. hepatica in cattle serum samples. This platform provides rapid, high-throughput results and is highly sensitive and specific in comparison to existing serological as well as coproscopical diagnostic techniques.

26079073|t|[First data concerning the medical supply of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in Germany - a survey in university hospital centers of hepatology].
26079073|a|UNASSIGNED: Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) currently is one oft the most common reasons for chronic liver injury in the western world. In the European and American population the prevalence is up to 30%. The medical supply of German patients with NAFLD is variable and has not been analyzed to date. Methods: We sent questionnaires to all university liver centers in Germany (11 questions) concerning the medical supply of patients with NAFLD. Questions included the rate of patients with fatty liver disease in the outpatient clinics, metabolic comorbidities and the kind of assignment. Besides that, individual clinical standards were documented. We compared longitudinal changes between 2008 and 2013. Results: The return rate of questionnaires was 65% (n=20). Analysis showed that the portion of NAFLD patients in the university outpatient clinics had increased between 2008 and 2013 with the predominant part of patients being assigned from external practitioners and not from internal departments of the hospital. Only few patients were assigned by diabetologists or endocrinologists, but on the other hand most liver outpatient clinics investigated their NAFLD patients for metabolic disorders. Cooperation between liver outpatient clinics and other medical services was moderate and was rated average, joint conferences were held rarely. Follow-up visits of patients with NAFLD take place regularly in all centers, however based on different criterions. A consistent algorithm concerning risk assessment and invasive workup does not exist. Conclusion: The awareness concerning patients with NAFLD seems to have grown in recent years. Nevertheless, the medical supply of these patients is quite heterogenous and consistent standards do not exist. Therefore, a common guidline is urgently required.

26078326|t|Analysis of Malaria Epidemiological Characteristics in the People's Republic of China, 2004-2013.
26078326|a|UNASSIGNED: This study aims to explore and characterize the malaria-endemic situation and trends from 2004 to 2013, to provide useful evidence for subsequently more effective strategic planning of malaria elimination in China. A total of 256,179 confirmed malaria cases were recorded in this period, and 86.8% of them were reported during 2004-2008. Between 2004 and 2008, Plasmodium vivax was the major species (72.2%) of malaria parasite. Most cases (67.3%) were found in male, and mainly in the age group of 34-39 years. A total of 236 deaths resulting from malaria were reported and nearly half (45.3%) of them were in Yunnan province. In all, 204,760 local malaria (79.9%) and 51,419 imported malaria (20.1%) were observed during 2004-2013. However, afterward the proportion of imported malaria continuously increased from 2004 (16.2%) to 2013 (97.9%). Moreover, 9,285 imported malaria cases were recorded during 2011-2013 in China, of which 5,976 cases (64.4%) came back from Africa. Overall, China has made achievements in controlling malaria, the locally transmitted malaria significantly declined in the past decades, by which the incidence has achieved historically the lowest levels. On the other hand, imported malaria has increasingly become a severe threat to malaria elimination. Therefore, to prevent the reintroduction of malaria, surveillance systems need to be well planned and managed to ensure timely case detection and prompt response at the elimination stage.

26061210|t|Treating separated liquid dairy manure derived from mesophilic anaerobic digester effluent to reduce indicator pathogens and Salmonella concentrations for use as organic fertilizer.
26061210|a|UNASSIGNED: Dairy manure has much potential for use as an organic fertilizer in the United States. However, the levels of indicator organisms and pathogens in dairy manure can be ten times higher than stipulated use guidelines by the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) even after undergoing anaerobic digestion at mesophilic temperatures. The objective of this study was to identify pasteurization temperatures and treatment durations to reduce fecal coliforms, E. coli, and Salmonella concentrations in separated liquid dairy manure (SLDM) of a mesophilic anaerobic digester effluent to levels sufficient for use as an organic fertilizer. Samples of SLDM were pasteurized at 70, 75, and 80  C for durations of 0 to 120  min. Fecal coliforms, E. coli, and Salmonella concentrations were assessed via culture-based techniques. All of the tested pasteurization temperatures and duration combinations reduced microbial concentrations to levels below the NOSB guidelines. The fecal coliforms and E. coli reductions ranged 2from 0.76 to 1.34 logs, while Salmonella concentrations were reduced by more than 99% at all the pasteurization temperatures and active treatment durations.

26059897|t|Intracellular microRNA profiles form in the Xenopus laevis oocyte that may contribute to asymmetric cell division.
26059897|a|Asymmetric distribution of fate determinants within cells is an essential biological strategy to prepare them for asymmetric division. In this work we measure the intracellular distribution of 12 maternal microRNAs (miRNA) along the animal-vegetal axis of the Xenopus laevis oocyte using qPCR tomography. We find the miRNAs have distinct intracellular profiles that resemble two out of the three profiles we previously observed for mRNAs. Our results suggest that miRNAs in addition to proteins and mRNAs may have asymmetric distribution within the oocyte and may contribute to asymmetric cell division as cell fate determinants.

In this paper we present two cases of women affected by Mayer-Rokitansky-K  ster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH). First case was a 17-year-old woman with aplasia of the upper vagina and absence of uterus. No other defects were found and was classified as type 1-MRKH. Second case was 18-year-old woman with absence of uterus, escoliosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, classified as type II-MRKH. Patients were seen at the Hospital with primary amenorrhea and fully developed secondary sexual characteristics. A clinical follow-up protocol, including the use of high-resolution image studies was used for diagnosis. Diagnostic procedures and current medical approaches to the treatment of MRKH are discussed, including psychological advisory, surgical procedures and new tissue-engineering techniques.

26062094|t|Induction of a quorum sensing pathway by environmental signals enhances group A streptococcal resistance to lysozyme.
26062094|a|UNASSIGNED: The human-restricted pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS) is responsible for wide-ranging pathologies at numerous sites in the body, but has the proclivity to proliferate in individuals asymptomatically. The ability to survive in diverse tissues is undoubtedly benefited by sensory pathways that recognize environmental cues corresponding to stress and nutrient availability and thereby trigger adaptive responses. We investigated the impact that environmental signals contribute to cell-to-cell chemical communication (quorum sensing, QS) by monitoring activity of the Rgg2/Rgg3 and SHP-pheromone system in GAS. We identified metal limitation and the alternate carbon source mannose as two environmental indicators likely to be encountered by GAS in the host that significantly induced the Rgg-SHP system. Disruption of the metal regulator MtsR partially accounted for the response to metal depletion, whereas ptsABCD was primarily responsible for QS induction due to mannose, but each sensory system induced Rgg-SHP signaling apparently by different mechanisms. Significantly, we found that induction of QS, regardless of the GAS serotype tested, led to enhanced resistance to the antimicrobial agent lysozyme. These results indicate the benefits for GAS to integrate environmental signals with intercellular communication pathways in protection from host defenses.

26018505|t|Improving the Anticancer Efficacy of Laminin Receptor-Specific Therapeutic Ruthenium Nanoparticles (RuBB-Loaded EGCG-RuNPs) via ROS-Dependent Apoptosis in SMMC-7721 Cells.
26018505|a|UNASSIGNED: Functionalization can promote the uptake of nanoparticles into cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, enabling them to exert their therapeutic effects. In this paper, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which has a high binding affinity to 67 kDa laminin receptor (67LR) overexpressed in HCC cells, was employed in the present study to functionalized ruthenium nanoparticles (RuNPs) loaded with luminescent ruthenium complexes to achieve antiliver cancer efficacy. [Ru(bpy)2(4-B)] (ClO4)2  2H2O (RuBB)-loaded EGCG-RuNPs (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) showed small particle size with narrow distribution, better stability, and high selectivity between liver cancer and normal cells. The internalization of RuBB-loaded EGCG-RuNPs was inhibited by 67LR-blocking antibody or laminin, suggesting that 67LR-mediated endocytosis played an important role in the uptake into HCC cells. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopic images showed that RuBB-loaded EGCG-RuNPs accumulated in the cytoplasm of SMMC-7721 cells. Furthermore, our results indicated that the EGCG-functionalized nanoparticles displayed enhanced anticancer effects in a target-specific manner. Concentrations of RuBB-loaded EGCG-RuNPs, nontoxic in normal L-02 cells, showed direct reactive oxygen species-dependent cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic, and anti-invasive effects in SMMC-7721 cells. Furthermore, in vivo animal study demonstrated that RuBB-loaded EGCG-RuNPs possessed high antitumor efficacy on tumor-bearing nude mice. It is encouraging to conclude that the multifunctional RuNPs may form the basis of new strategies on the treatment of liver cancer and other malignancies.

26059217|a|UNASSIGNED: The behavior of ZnO nanowires under uniaxial loading is characterized by means of a numerical model that accounts for all coupled mechanical, electrical, and thermal effects. The paper shows that thermal effects in the nanowires may greatly impact the predicted performance of piezoelectric and piezotronic nanodevices. The pyroelectric effect introduces new equivalent volumic charge in the body of the nanowire and surface charges at the boundaries, where Kapitza resistances are located, that act together with the piezoelectric charges to improve the predicted performance. It is shown that the proposed model is able to reproduce several effects experimentally observed by other research groups, and is a promising tool for the design of ultra-high efficient nanodevices.

26043850|t|Vitamin D Status and Adiposity in Pediatric Malabsorption Syndromes.
26043850|a|BACKGROUND: The combined effects of nutrient malabsorption and adiposity on vitamin D status are unclear in pediatric malabsorption syndromes. AIM: To determine the relationship between adiposity and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in malabsorption disorders. METHODS: Prepubertal children of ages 3-12 with either lactose intolerance (LI) (n = 38, age 8.61    3.08, male/female 19/19), or celiac disease (CD) (n = 24) were compared to healthy controls (n = 49, age 7.95    2.64, male/female 28/21). A separate cohort of combined prepubertal and pubertal subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (n = 59, age 16.4    2.2, male/female 31/27) were also compared to healthy controls (n = 116, male/female 49/67, age 14.6    4.4). Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D of <50 nmol/l, overweight as body mass index (BMI) of >= 85th but <95th percentile, and obesity as BMI >= 95th percentile. RESULTS: Among the controls, 25(OH)D was significantly higher in the normal-weight prepubertal controls vs. the overweight/obese controls (p = 0.001), and similarly so for the combined cohort of prepubertal and pubertal controls (p = 0.031). In contrast, there was no significant difference in 25(OH)D concentration between the normal-weight vs. overweight/obese patients with LI (p = 0.335), CD (p = 0.387), and IBD (p = 0.883). CONCLUSION: There is no association between adiposity and serum 25(OH)D in pediatric malabsorption syndromes.    2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

26048078|t|The Arabidopsis epitranscriptome.
26048078|a|UNASSIGNED: The most prevalent internal modification of plant messenger RNAs, N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), was first discovered in the 1970s, then largely forgotten. However, the impact of modifications to eukaryote mRNA, collectively known as the epitranscriptome, has recently attracted renewed attention. mRNA methylation is required for normal Arabidopsis development and the first methylation maps reveal that thousands of Arabidopsis mRNAs are methylated. Arabidopsis is likely to be a model of wide utility in understanding the biological impacts of the epitranscriptome. We review recent progress and look ahead with questions awaiting answers to reveal an entire layer of gene regulation that has until recently been overlooked.

26038692|t|Pituitary injury and persistent hypofunction resulting from a peripartum non-hemorrhagic, vaso-occlusive event.
26038692|a|Cerebral vascular accidents are caused by vasospasm when induced by preeclampsia or by dopamine agonists. However, six arteries nourish the pituitary and prevent against vasospasm-induced damage, which up until now has not been thought to occur. Bromocriptine was used to arrest lactation in a 31-year-old with secondary amenorrhea following preeclampsia and fetal demise at 28 weeks gestation. Tests and history revealed panhypopituitarism not associated with hemorrhage or mass infarction but instead caused by vasospasm. The present study is the first report of pituitary damage from a non-hemorrhagic, vaso-occlusive event in the literature. In keeping with Sheehan's and Simon's syndromes, we have named pituitary damage resulting from vaso-occlusion as Dahan's syndrome, and a literature review suggests that it may be a common and previously overlooked disorder. LEARNING POINTS: Vasospasm can cause damage to the pituitary gland, although it was not previously believed to do so.Preeclampsia and the use of a dopamine agonist, particularly in the peripartum state, may trigger vasospasm.Vasospasm resulting from dopamine agonists may be a common cause of injury to the pituitary gland, and it may have been overlooked in the past.

26044801|t|Prevalence of Sleep-Disordered Breathing-Related Symptoms in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction.
26044801|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is highly prevalent in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and is associated with a poor prognosis. Data on SDB-related symptoms and vigilance impairment in patients with CHF and SDB are rare. Thus, the objective of the present study was to assess a wide spectrum of SDB-related symptoms and objective vigilance testing in patients with CHF with and without SDB. METHODS: Patients with CHF (n  = 222; average age, 62 years; left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], 34%) underwent polysomnography regardless of the presence or absence of SDB-related symptoms. Patients were stratified into those with no SDB (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] < 15 episodes/h), moderate SDB (AHI >=  15 to < 30 episodes/h), and severe SDB (AHI >=  30 episodes/h). A standardized institutional questionnaire assessing a wide spectrum of SDB-related symptoms was applied. A subset of patients underwent objective vigilance testing (Quatember Maly, 100 stimuli within 25 minutes). RESULTS: Daytime fatigue (no SDB, moderate SDB, and severe SDB: 53%, 69%, and 80%, respectively; P  = 0.005), unintentional sleep (9%, 15%, and 32%, respectively; P  = 0.004), and xerostomia (52%, 49%, and 70%, respectively; P  = 0.018), as well as an impaired objective vigilance test result (mean reaction time, 0.516, 0.497, and 0.579 ms, respectively; P < 0.001) occurred more frequently with increasing severity of SDB. Seventy-eight percent of patients with CHF and SDB had at least 3 SDB-related symptoms. In a linear multivariable regression model, the frequency of daytime fatigue (P  = 0.014), unintentional sleep (P  = 0.001), xerostomia (P  = 0.016), and mean reaction time (P  = 0.001) were independently associated with increasing AHI independent of age, body mass index, New York Heart Association functional class, and LVEF. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with CHF and SDB have several potential SDB-related symptoms and objective impairment of vigilance as potential treatment targets.

26046972|t|Induction of cytotoxic and genotoxic responses by natural and novel quercetin glycosides.
26046972|a|UNASSIGNED: The flavonoids quercetin, and its natural glycosides isoquercetin and rutin, are phytochemicals commonly consumed in plant-derived foods. Semi-synthetic water-soluble isoquercetin and rutin glycosides, maltooligosyl isoquercetin, monoglucosyl rutin and maltooligosyl rutin were developed by synthetic glycosylation to overcome solubility challenges for improved incorporation in food and medicinal applications. Quercetin and its natural glycosides are known to induce genetic instability and decrease cell proliferation. Using a system of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, this study examined the differences in cytotoxic and genotoxic responses induced by natural and synthetic flavonoids. Bioactivity evaluations using poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) ELISA showed that the synthetic flavonoids were less effective in inhibiting PARP than the natural flavonoids, where PARP inhibitory effects decreased with glycosylation of flavonoids. In the genotoxic studies, treatments with flavonoids at a concentration range of 0.2 M-1mM induced significant frequencies of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronuclei in CHO cells compared to spontaneous occurrences. The synthetic flavonoids monoglucosyl rutin and maltooligosyl rutin induced less genotoxic effects than the natural flavonoids. However, maltooligosyl isoquercetin induced similar responses as isoquercetin and rutin. The growth inhibition studies showed glycosylation dependent cytotoxicity in natural flavonoids. The quercetin aglycone exhibited the highest toxicity out of all the flavonoids studied. Differences in growth inhibition were not observed between the synthetic flavonoids, maltooligosyl isoquercetin and monoglucosyl rutin, and natural isoquercetin and rutin, respectively. Maltooligosyl rutin induced less cytotoxicity than rutin and monoglucosyl rutin. Our in vitro studies demonstrated that the synthetic flavonoids generally induced less genotoxic responses than their natural counterparts.

26002931|t|Inexhaustible hair-cell regeneration in young and aged zebrafish.
26002931|a|UNASSIGNED: Animals have evolved two general strategies to counter injury and maintain physiological function. The most prevalent is protection by isolating vital organs into body cavities. However, protection is not optimal for sensory systems because their external components need to be exposed to the environment to fulfill their receptive function. Thus, a common strategy to maintain sensory abilities against persistent environmental insult involves repair and regeneration. However, whether age or frequent injuries affect the regenerative capacity of sensory organs remains unknown. We have found that neuromasts of the zebrafish lateral line regenerate mechanosensory hair cells after recurrent severe injuries and in adulthood. Moreover, neuromasts can reverse transient imbalances of Notch signaling that result in defective organ proportions during repair. Our results reveal inextinguishable hair-cell regeneration in the lateral line, and suggest that the neuromast epithelium is formed by plastic territories that are maintained by continuous intercellular communication.

26014667|t|Are we overpathologizing everyday life? A tenable blueprint for behavioral addiction research.
26014667|a|UNASSIGNED: Background Behavioral addiction research has been particularly flourishing over the last two decades. However, recent publications have suggested that nearly all daily life activities might lead to a genuine addiction. Methods and aim In this article, we discuss how the use of atheoretical and confirmatory research approaches may result in the identification of an unlimited list of "new" behavioral addictions. Results Both methodological and theoretical shortcomings of these studies were discussed. Conclusions We suggested that studies overpathologizing daily life activities are likely to prompt a dismissive appraisal of behavioral addiction research. Consequently, we proposed several roadmaps for future research in the field, centrally highlighting the need for longer tenable behavioral addiction research that shifts from a mere criteria-based approach toward an approach focusing on the psychological processes involved.

26055478|t|Seed/Catalyst-Free Growth of Gallium-Based Compound Materials on Graphene on Insulator by Electrochemical Deposition at Room Temperature.
26055478|a|We report the growth of gallium-based compounds, i.e., gallium oxynitride (GaON) and gallium oxide (Ga2O3) on multilayer graphene (MLG) on insulator using a mixture of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and gallium nitrate (Ga(NO3)3) by electrochemical deposition (ECD) method at room temperature (RT) for the first time. The controlling parameters of current density and electrolyte molarity were found to greatly influence the properties of the grown structures. The thicknesses of the deposited structures increase with the current density since it increases the chemical reaction rates. The layers grown at low molarities of both solutions basically show grain-like layer with cracking structures and dominated by both Ga2O3 and GaON. Such cracking structures seem to diminish with the increases of molarities of one of the solutions. It is speculated that the increase of current density and ions in the solutions helps to promote the growth at the area with uneven thicknesses of graphene. When the molarity of Ga(NO3)3 is increased while keeping the molarity of NH4NO3 at the lowest value of 2.5 M, the grown structures are basically dominated by the Ga2O3 structure. On the other hand, when the molarity of NH4NO3 is increased while keeping the molarity of Ga(NO3)3 at the lowest value of 0.8 M, the GaON structure seems to dominate where their cubic and hexagonal arrangements are coexisting. It was found that when the molarities of Ga(NO3)3 are at the high level of 7.5 M, the grown structures tend to be dominated by Ga2O3 even though the molarity of NH4NO3 is made equal or higher than the molarity of Ga(NO3)3. When the grown structure is dominated by the Ga2O3 structure, the deposition process became slow or unstable, resulting to the formation of thin layer. When the molarity of Ga(NO3)3 is increased to 15 M, the nanocluster-like structures were formed instead of continuous thin film structure. This study seems to successfully provide the conditions in growing either GaON-dominated or Ga2O3-dominated structure by a simple and low-cost ECD. The next possible routes to convert the grown GaON-dominated structure to either single-crystalline GaN or Ga2O3 as well as Ga2O3-dominated structure to single-crystalline Ga2O3 structure have been discussed.

26055482|t|Observation of Shape, Configuration, and Density of Au Nanoparticles on Various GaAs Surfaces via Deposition Amount, Annealing Temperature, and Dwelling Time.
26055482|a|Metallic nanoparticles have been widely witnessed in many applications: serving as the catalysts for various nanowire systems, as the active mediums of various device applications, and also for the nanoscale templates for hybrid quantum structures. In the performance of devices and configurations of the resulting nanostructures, the size and density of nanoparticles play critical roles. In this paper, the control of self-assembled Au droplets on GaAs (100), (110), and (111) is systematically investigated through the variation of deposition amount (DA), annealing temperature (AT), and dwelling time (DT). Based on the Volmer-Weber growth model, the formation of Au droplets and dramatic evolution of Au nanostructures on various GaAs surfaces is observed from the Au clusters to the round-dome shapes with the AT variation between 250 and 550    C. With the systematic DA control, a radical size and density evolution of Au droplets shows the size expansion of over 400  % in average height and 800  % in average lateral diameter, while the density shows over two orders of decrease. With the DT variation, the self-assembled Au droplets tend to grow larger due to the Ostwald ripening while a clear distinction among the surface indexes is observed.

26028482|t|The chalcone compound isosalipurposide (ISPP) exerts a cytoprotective effect against oxidative injury via Nrf2 activation.
26028482|a|UNASSIGNED: The chalcone compound isosalipurposide (ISPP) has been successfully isolated from the native Korean plant species Corylopsis coreana Uyeki (Korean winter hazel). However, the therapeutic efficacy of ISPP remains poorly understood. This study investigated whether ISPP has the capacity to activate NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2)-antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling and induce its target gene expression, and to determined the protective role of ISPP against oxidative injury of hepatocytes. In HepG2 cells, nuclear translocation of Nrf2 is augmented by ISPP treatment. Consistently, ISPP increased ARE reporter gene activity and the protein levels of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) and hemeoxygenase (HO-1), resulting in increased intracellular glutathione levels. Cells pretreated with ISPP were rescued from tert-butylhydroperoxide-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and glutathione depletion and consequently, apoptotic cell death. Moreover, ISPP ameliorated the mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis induced by rotenone which is an inhibitor of complex 1 of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The specific role of Nrf2 activation by ISPP was demonstrated using an ARE-deletion mutant plasmid and Nrf2-knockout cells. Finally, we observed that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but not protein kinase C (PKC)-   or other mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), are involved in the activation of Nrf2 by ISPP. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ISPP has a cytoprotective effect against oxidative damage mediated through Nrf2 activation and induction of its target gene expression in hepatocytes.

26090850|t|Exonic Re-Sequencing of the Chromosome 2q24.3 Parkinson's Disease Locus.
26090850|a|UNASSIGNED: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) have identified over 20 genomic regions associated with disease risk. Many of these loci include several candidate genes making it difficult to pinpoint the causal gene. The locus on chromosome 2q24.3 encompasses three genes: B3GALT1, STK39, and CERS6. In order to identify if the causal variants are simple missense changes, we sequenced all 31 exons of these three genes in 187 patients with PD. We identified 13 exonic variants including four non-synonymous and three insertion/deletion variants (indels). These non-synonymous variants and rs2102808, the GWAS tag SNP, were genotyped in three independent series consisting of a total of 1976 patients and 1596 controls. Our results show that the seven identified 2q24.3 coding variants are not independently responsible for the GWAS association signal at the locus; however, there is a haplotype, which contains both rs2102808 and a STK39 exon 1 6bp indel variant, that is significantly associated with PD risk (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.11-1.64, P = 0.003). This haplotype is more associated than each of the two variants independently (OR = 1.23, P = 0.005 and 1.10, P = 0.10, respectively). Our findings suggest that the risk variant is likely located in a non-coding region. Additional sequencing of the locus including promoter and regulatory regions will be needed to pinpoint the association at this locus that leads to an increased risk to PD.

26028088|t|No Association between the CCR5  32 Polymorphism and Sporadic Esophageal Cancer in Punjab, North-West India.
26028088|a|BACKGROUND: Chemokines and their receptors influence carcinogenesis and cysteine-cysteine chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) directs spread of cancer to other tissues. A 32 base pair deletion in the coding region of CCR5 that might alter the expression or function of the protein has been implicated in a variety of immune-mediated diseases. The action of antiviral drugs being proposed as adjuvant therapy in cancer is dependent on CCR5 wild type status. In the present study, distribution of CCR5  32 polymorphism was assessed in North Indian esophageal cancer patients to explore the potential of using chemokine receptors antagonists as adjuvant therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA samples of 175 sporadic esophageal cancer patients (69 males and 106 females) and 175 unrelated healthy control individuals (69 males and 106 females) were screened for the CCR5  32 polymorphism by direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The frequencies of wild type homozygous (CCR5/CCR5), heterozygous (CCR5/  32) and homozygous mutant (  32/  32) genotypes were 96.0 vs 97.72%, 4.0 vs 1.71% and 0 vs 0.57% in patients and controls respectively. There was no difference in the genotype and allele frequencies of CCR5  32 polymorphism in esophageal cancer patients and control group. CONCLUSIONS: The CCR5  32 polymorphism is not associated with esophageal cancer in North Indians. As the majority of patients express the wild type allele, there is potential of using antiviral drug therapy as adjuvant therapy.

26031415|t|Effect of stereotactic dosimetric end points on overall survival for Stage I non-small cell lung cancer: A critical review.
26031415|a|UNASSIGNED: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivers a high biologically effective dose while minimizing toxicities to surrounding tissues. Within the scope of clinical trials and local practice, there are inconsistencies in dosimetrics used to evaluate plan quality. The purpose of this critical review was to determine if dosimetric parameters used in SBRT plans have an effect on local control (LC), overall survival (OS), and toxicities. A database of relevant trials investigating SBRT for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer was compiled, and a table of dosimetric variables used was created. These parameters were compared and contrasted for LC, OS, and toxicities. Dosimetric end points appear to have no effect on OS or LC. Incidences of rib fractures correlate with a lack of dose-volume constraints (DVCs) reported. This review highlights the great disparity present in clinical trials reporting dosimetrics, DVCs, and toxicities for lung SBRT. Further evidence is required before standard DVCs guidelines can be introduced. Dosimetric end points specific to stereotactic treatment planning have been proposed but require further investigation before clinical implementation.

26035033|t|Combination Therapies of Diacerein and Febuxostat Inhibit IL-1b Responses and Improve Clinical Symptoms in Patients With Refractory Gout.
26035033|a|UNASSIGNED: There are several therapeutic strategies available for the treatment of an acute gout attack and the prevention of recurrent gout flares, and they include nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs. This prospective study was aimed at evaluating the efficiency and safety of diacerein in combination with febuxostat on urate control, global assessments of disease activity, self-monitored gouty acute flare times, inflammatory markers, and clinical symptoms associated with their life quantity in patients with refractory gout. A total of 64 patients with refractory gout were sequentially recruited and prescribed with oral febuxostat alone or febuxostat plus diacerein daily for 12 weeks. The intensity of joint pain, numbers of acute flare, disease activity and the levels of serum amyloid A, mature IL-1b, IL-18, C-reactive protein, and urate in individual subjects were routine analyzed. In comparison with that treatment with febuxostat alone, treatment with both drugs for 12 weeks had a better therapeutic effect on reducing the values of visual analog scales, acute flares, and healthy assessment questionnaire scores in these gout patients. Furthermore, treatment with both drugs also significantly reduced the mean daily dose of etoricoxib and the levels of serum IL-1b and serum amyloid A. There was no significant difference in the frequency of patients with adverse effect between these 2 groups of patients. In conclusion, combination of diacerein and febuxostat had better therapeutic effect on reducing acute gout flares, inflammation, and clinical symptoms in patients with refractory gout.

26039060|t|Reliable Screening of Dye Phototoxicity by Using a Caenorhabditis elegans Fast Bioassay.
26039060|a|UNASSIGNED: Phototoxicity consists in the capability of certain innocuous molecules to become toxic when subjected to suitable illumination. In order to discover new photoactive drugs or characterize phototoxic pollutants, it would be advantageous to use simple biological tests of phototoxicy. In this work, we present a pilot screening of 37 dyes to test for phototoxic effects in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Populations of this nematode were treated with different dyes, and subsequently exposed to 30 min of white light. Behavioral outcomes were quantified by recording the global motility using an infrared tracking device (WMicrotracker). Of the tested compounds, 17 dyes were classified as photoactive, being phloxine B, primuline, eosin Y, acridine orange and rose Bengal the most phototoxic. To assess photoactivity after uptake, compounds were retested after washing them out of the medium before light irradiation. Dye uptake into the worms was also analyzed by staining or fluorescence. All the positive drugs were incorporated by animals and produced phototoxic effects after washing. We also tested the stress response being triggered by the treatments through reporter strains. Endoplasmic reticulum stress response (hsp-4::GFP strain) was activated by 22% of phototoxic dyes, and mitochondrial stress response (hsp-6::GFP strain) was induced by 16% of phototoxic dyes. These results point to a phototoxic perturbation of the protein functionality and an oxidative stress similar to that reported in cell cultures. Our work shows for the first time the feasibility of C. elegans for running phototoxic screenings and underscores its application on photoactive drugs and environmental pollutants assessment.

26016510|t|Spontaneous Blinking Kinetics on Paralytic Lagophthalmos After Lid Load with Gold Weight or Autogenous Temporalis Fascia Sling.
26016510|a|PURPOSE: To assess the upper eyelid kinematics during spontaneous blinking in unilateral paralytic lagophthalmos before and after upper eyelid load with gold weight (GW) or autogenous temporalis fascia (TF) sling. DESIGN: Comparative case series. SUBJECTS: Patients with long-standing unresolved unilateral facial palsy who underwent surgical treatment with GW (n   =   8) or upper lid cerclage with TF (n   =   10). The contralateral eyelid served as the control for each patient (control group). METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative measurements of spontaneous blink kinematics with magnetic search coil and clinical assessment of lid margin position, lagophthalmos and ocular surface exposure, and determine amplitude, maximum velocity and main sequence of spontaneous blinks; relative amplitude of blinks to the pupil center; ocular surface exposure scores; magnitude of lagophthalmos and mid-pupil lid distances. RESULTS: The mean (  SE) down-phase amplitude ratio between paralyzed and contralateral eyelids (blink gain) was 10.0% preoperatively for both groups and significantly increased to 29        6% for the GW group (p   <   0.05) and 23        4% for the TF group (p   <   0.05). At 6 months the gain was significant for the GW group only (32        7%, p   <   0.05). There was no effect on the maximum velocity of the blinks or the main sequence of paretic and contralateral blinks with either surgery. Both procedures lowered the lid margin increasing the number of blinks that reached the pupil center. At 6 months this effect was prominent only for the GW group. Exposure keratopathy scores and lagophthalmos decreased postoperatively especially in the GW group. CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effect of lid load surgeries result from a combination of a small increase on the spontaneous blink amplitude and a static effect due to the reduction of the distance between the lid margin and pupil center.

26017791|t|Tanshinone IIA attenuates interleukin-17A-induced systemic sclerosis patient-derived dermal vascular smooth muscle cell activation via inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway.
26017791|a|OBJECTIVE: Salvia miltiorrhiza has long been used to treat systemic sclerosis. Tanshinone IIA, one of the phytochemicals derived from the roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza, exhibits multiple biological activities. The present study aimed to investigate whether tanshinone IIA has an effect on the interleukin-17A-induced functional activation of systemic sclerosis patient-derived dermal vascular smooth muscle cells. METHODS: Systemic sclerosis patient-derived dermal vascular smooth muscle cells were incubated with various dosages of tanshinone IIA in the presence of interleukin-17A or the serum of systemic sclerosis patients. Cell proliferation was assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8. The expression of collagen 1 and 3 in cells was evaluated by immunofluorescence. Cell migration was measured using a transwell assay. The expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase was detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: Our data demonstrate that tanshinone IIA exerts an inhibitory effect on interleukin-17A-induced systemic sclerosis patient-derived dermal vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, collagen synthesis and migration. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that tanshinone IIA might serve as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of systemic sclerosis.

26052067|t|Serum N-glycan profiles in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas.
26052067|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Diagnosing the invasiveness of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) is difficult, especially by blood test. Alterations in serum glycan profiles have been reported for several cancers, but changes in serum glycan profiles have not been investigated in patients with IPMNs. The objectives of this study were to determine the serum N-glycan profile and to investigate its clinical utility in patients with IPMNs. METHODS: We measured serum N-glycan profiles in 79 patients with IPMNs, including 13 invasive IPMNs, by performing comprehensive glycome analysis and assessed the relationship between N-glycan changes and clinical parameters. RESULTS: Seventy glycans were identified and their expression profiles were significantly different depending on the cyst size, the presence of an enhancing solid component, and the histological grade of the IPMN. Nine glycans were highly expressed in patients with invasive IPMNs. The glycan m/z 3195, which is a fucosylated tri-antennary glycan, had the highest diagnostic value for distinguishing invasive IPMNs from non-invasive IPMNs (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  =  0.803). Multivariate analyses revealed high levels of m/z 3195 [odds ratio (OR), 20.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.60-486.4] and the presence of enhancing solid components (OR, 35.8; 95% CI, 5.39-409.6) were significant risk factors for invasive IPMNs. CONCLUSIONS: We performed a comprehensive evaluation of the changes in serum N-glycan profiles in patients with IPMNs for the first time. We determined that increased expression of fucosylated complex-type glycans, especially m/z 3195, is a potential marker for invasive IPMNs.

26001376|t|Listeria monocytogenes-carrying consortia in food industry. Composition, subtyping and numerical characterisation of mono-species biofilm dynamics on stainless steel.
26001376|a|UNASSIGNED: In order to find out how real Listeria monocytogenes-carrying biofilms are in industrial settings, a total of 270 environmental samples belonging to work surfaces from fish (n=123), meat (n=75) and dairy industries (n=72) were analysed in order to detect L. monocytogenes. 12 samples were positive for L. monocytogenes and a total of 18 different species were identified as accompanying microbiota in fish and meat industry. No L. monocytogenes was found in samples from dairy industry. Molecular characterisation combining results of AscI and ApaI macrorestriction PFGE assays yielded 7 different subtypes of L. monocytogenes sharing in 71.43% of cases the same serogroup (1/2a-3a). Results from dynamic numerical characterisation between L. monocytogenes monospecies biofilms on stainless steel (SS) using MATLAB-based tool BIOFILMDIVER demonstrated that except in isolate A1, in which a significant increase in the percentage of covered area (CA), average diffusion distance (ADD) and maximum diffusion distance (MDD) was observed after 120h of culture, no significant differences were observed in the dynamics of the rest of the L. monocytogenes isolates. Quantitative dual-species biofilm association experiments performed on SS indicated that L. monocytogenes cell counts presented lower values in mixed-species cultures with certain species at 24 and 48h compared with mono-species culture. However, they remained unaltered after 72h except when co-cultured with Serratia fonticola which presented differences in all sampling times and was also the dominant species within the dual-species biofilm. When considering frequency of appearance of accompanying species, an ecological distribution was demonstrated as Escherichia coli appeared to be the most abundant in fish industry and Carnobacterium spp. in meat industry.

26050236|t|Effects of Arsenic Trioxide Exposure on Heat Shock Protein Response in the Immune Organs of Chickens.
26050236|a|UNASSIGNED: Arsenic trioxide (As2O3), a kind of pentavalent arsenic, has recently been linked to disrupted immune function. Heat shock proteins (Hsps), a group of highly conserved proteins, are rapidly synthesised when living organisms are exposed to various stress conditions. The objective of this study is to determine the effects of As2O3 on the expression level of Hsps (Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp60, Hsp40 and Hsp27) in the immune organs (spleen, thymus and bursa of Fabricius (BF)) of chickens. A total of 72 1-day-old male Hy-line chickens were randomly divided into four groups, including the low-As group (L group), middle-As group (M group), high-As group (H group) and control group (C group). Immune organs were collected, and levels of Hsp messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were examined on days 30, 60 and 90. The results showed that the levels of Hsp mRNA (Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp60, Hsp40 and Hsp27) and protein (Hsp70 and Hsp60) expression were significantly increased (p   <   0.05 or p   <   0.01) in the As2O3 treatment groups compared with the corresponding control groups. Taken together, these results suggest that As2O3 influences the level of Hsps in immune organs.

26102799|t|3B.04: IMPAIRED ENDOTHELIAL VASODILATOR FUNCTION IN NORMOTENSIVE ADOLESCENTS WITH EXAGGERATED EXERCISE BLOOD PRESSURE RESPONSE.
26102799|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate endothelial function in normotensive adolescents with exaggerated blood pressure response during exercise. DESIGN AND METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study conducted with 157 high school students (80 boys and 77 girls), aged between 13 to 18 years old (15.0  1.6), normotensive, without smoking habits, non-obese, normolipidemic and normal glucose. An exaggerated blood pressure response was defined as a systolic pressure rise of more than 70mm Hg, during the treadmill test with Bruce protocol. The endothelial function was assessed through endothelium-dependent vasodilation with reactive hyperemia test by high-resolution vascular ultrasound. The cohort was split into quartiles, according to flow-mediated dilation (FMD). The study comparison was made between the lowest quartile versus the rest of them. RESULTS: An exaggerated blood pressure response was observed in 13 adolescents (8.3%), 10 (13.0%) females and 3 (3.8%) males (P=0.036). For adolescents in the lowest FMD quartile, a higher prevalence of exaggerated blood pressure response was observed, in comparison with the others quartiles (17.5 vs 5.1%, respectively; P=0.014). Even after adjustment for factors known to affect endothelial function, the logistic regression analysis revealed that an exercise-induced hypertension was a predictor of impaired FMD (OR=3.924; I.C. 95%: 1.233-12.488). CONCLUSIONS: Normotensive adolescents with exercise-induced hypertension have impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Exercise blood pressure may thus be a useful marker of nitric oxide bioactivity, and hence an important cardiac prognostic factor.

26099359|t|P2X7 receptors and Fyn kinase mediate ATP-induced oligodendrocyte progenitor cell migration.
26099359|a|UNASSIGNED: Recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to the lesions is the most important event for remyelination after central nervous system (CNS) injury or in demyelinating diseases. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood. In the present study, we found high concentrations of ATP could increase the number of migrating OPCs in vitro, while after pretreatment with oxidized ATP (a P2X7 receptor antagonist), the promotive effect was attenuated. The promotive effect of 2'(3')-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (BzATP) (a P2X7 receptor agonist) was more potent than ATP. After incubation with BzATP, the activity of Fyn, one member of the Src family of kinases, was enhanced. Moreover, the interaction between P2X7 and Fyn was identified by co-immunoprecipitation. After blocking the activity of Fyn or down-regulating the expression of Fyn, the migration of OPCs induced by BzATP was inhibited. These data indicate that P2X7 receptors/Fyn may mediate ATP-induced OPC migration under pathological conditions.

26092743|t|Family-based Treatment of Child and Adolescent Eating Disorders.
26092743|a|Best-practice guidelines for the treatment of child and adolescent eating disorders recommend the inclusion of parents. Family-based treatment (FBT) posits that families are not only important in supporting their children but are critical change agents in the recovery process. As originally developed for anorexia nervosa, parents take a central role in managing and disrupting eating disorder symptoms. The most evidence-based treatment model for adolescent anorexia nervosa, FBT has also recently been found to be useful in the treatment of adolescent bulimia nervosa. This article provides a summary of the theoretic model, evidence base, and application of FBT.

26101062|t|6-Shogaol induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human hepatoma cells through pleiotropic mechanisms.
26101062|a|UNASSIGNED: Shogaols are a group of the active constituents of ginger that have been identified to have various biological activities. The aim of the current study was to investigate the antitumor activity of 6-shogaol in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the possible involvement of reactive oxygen species as a putative mechanism of action. HCC cell lines, HepG2 and Huh-7, were used to study the in vitro anti-cancer activity of 6-shogaol via the application of various molecular biology techniques. Results showed that 6-shogaol effectively inhibited the cell viability, caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and induced apoptosis in HCC cells as indicated by MTT assay, DAPI nuclear staining, annexin V assay, cell cycle analysis, and activation of caspase-3. Western blot analysis revealed the ability of 6-shogaol to target cancer survival signaling pathways mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Akt. In addition, 6-Shogaol induced alteration of cyclin proteins expression and caused cleavage of protein kinase C delta. Furthermore, 6-Shogaol was able to induce the production of reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated proteins and the consequent activation of autophagy in HepG2 cells. Taken together, the current study highlights evidences that 6-shogaol induces apoptosis, modulatescyclins expression and targets cancer survival signaling pathways in HCC cell lines, at least in part, via the production of reactive oxygen species. These findings support 6-shogaol's clinical promise as a potential candidate for HCC therapy.

26092165|t|Measuring the effect of Choosing Wisely: an integrated framework to assess campaign impact on low-value care.
26092165|a|UNASSIGNED: The Choosing Wisely campaign began in the USA in 2012 to encourage physicians and patients to discuss inappropriate and potentially harmful tests, treatments and procedures. Since its inception, the campaign has grown substantially and has been adopted by 12 countries around the world. Of great interest to countries implementing the campaign, is the effectiveness of Choosing Wisely to reduce overutilisation. This article presents an integrated measurement framework that may be used to assess the impact of a Choosing Wisely campaign on physician and provider awareness and attitudes on low-value care, provider practice behaviour and overuse of low-value services.

26102346|t|Semiparametric estimation in the proportional hazard model accounting for a misclassified cause of failure.
26102346|a|UNASSIGNED: Misclassified causes of failures are a common phenomenon in competing risks survival data such as cancer mortality. We propose new estimating equations for a semiparametric proportional hazards (PH) model with misattributed causes of failures. Unlike other methods, the estimator does not require any parametric assumptions on baseline cause-specific hazard rates. It is shown that the estimators for regression coefficients are consistent and asymptotically normal. Simulation results support the theoretical analysis in finite samples. The methods are applied to analyze prostate cancer survival.

26100638|t|A Polybasic Plasma Membrane Binding Motif in the I-II Linker Stabilizes Voltage-Gated Cav1.2 Calcium Channel Function.
26100638|a|UNASSIGNED: L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+)-channels (LTCCs) regulate many physiological functions like muscle contraction, hormone secretion, gene expression and neuronal excitability. Their activity is strictly controlled by various molecular mechanisms. The pore-forming a1-subunit comprises four repeated domains (I-IV), each connected via an intracellular linker. Here we identified a polybasic plasma membrane binding motif, consisting of four arginines, within the I-II-linker of all LTCCs. The primary structure of this motif is similar to polybasic clusters known to interact with polyphosphoinositides identified in other ion channels. We used de novo molecular modeling to predict the conformation of this polybasic motif, immunofluorescence microscopy and live-cell imaging to investigate the interaction with the plasma membrane, as well as electrophysiology to study its role for Cav1.2-channel function. According to our models this polybasic motif of the I-II-linker forms a straight a-helix, with the positive charges facing the lipid phosphates of the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Membrane binding of the I-II-linker could be reversed after phospholipase C activation causing polyphosphoinositide breakdown, and was accelerated by elevated intracellular Ca(2+)-levels. This indicates the involvement of negatively charged phospholipids in the plasma membrane targeting of the linker. Neutralization of four arginine residues eliminated plasma membrane binding. Patch-clamp recordings revealed facilitated opening of Cav1.2-channels containing these mutations, weaker inhibition by PLC activation and reduced expression of channels (as quantified by ON-gating charge) at the plasma membrane. Our data provide new evidence for a membrane binding motif within the I-II-linker of LTCC a1-subunits essential for stabilizing normal Ca(2+)-channel function.

26092764|t|Quality of Life After Conservation Surgery for Laryngeal Cancer.
26092764|a|UNASSIGNED: Quality of life preservation has become an essential goal of treatment in the management of laryngeal carcinoma. Although established treatments of reference such as total laryngectomy and chemoradiation protocols have focused on survival and anatomic preservation of the larynx, they still generate considerable functional morbidity with detrimental effects on quality of life. Transoral and transcervical partial laryngectomy techniques can offer significant advantages when used prudently after proper patient selection. The growing relevance of those techniques in the management of advanced and recurrent laryngeal carcinoma deserves particular attention, with potential for improved quality of life without compromising oncologic outcomes.

26055951|t|A retrospective dosimetric comparison of TG43 and a commercially available MBDCA for an APBI brachytherapy patient cohort.
26055951|a|PURPOSE: To compare dosimetry using a contemporary model based dose calculation algorithm (MBDCA) following TG186 recommendations, and the conventional TG43 method in an (192)Ir high dose rate (HDR) accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) patient cohort. METHODS: Data of 38 APBI patients were studied. Dosimetry for the treatment plans was performed using both the TG43 and TG186 dose calculation methods of the Oncentra Brachy v4.4 treatment planning system (TPS). Analysis included indices of clinical interest for the planning target volume (PTV coverage, dose homogeneity, conformity) as well as dose volume histograms (DVH) for the breast, lung, heart, rib and skin. Significance testing of observed differences between TG43 and TG186 results was carried out and the effect of target location to these differences was studied. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed in the values of clinically relevant DVH parameters for the PTV and the organs at risk (OAR), except for the heart. Differences for the PTV are relatively small (<1% for coverage, on the order of 2% for homogeneity and conformity) with a slight TG43 overestimation except for the dose homogeneity. Percentage differences are larger for the rib and lung (on the order of 4% for Dmax and 5% for V10Gy, respectively) and maximum for the skin (on the order of 6% for D10cc), with a correlation of the observed differences with target location. CONCLUSION: While the MBDCA option of the TPS appears to improve dosimetric accuracy, differences from TG43 do not appear to warrant dose prescription changes or treatment protocol amendment..

26055677|t|Insomnia and Anxiety: Diagnostic and Management Implications of Complex Interactions.
26055677|a|UNASSIGNED: Concurrent clinical presentation of insomnia and anxiety is frequent in clinical practice. The onset and course of anxiety and insomnia are intimately related; traditional conceptualizations of insomnia as secondary to anxiety are no longer clinically viable. Evolving evidence suggests a relationship between these 2 conditions that is complex and reciprocal and that evolves over time. In terms of diagnosis and management, unless initial assessment and intervention are initiated in the earliest stages of illness, emerging opinion supports recognition of cooccurring anxiety and insomnia as independent comorbid conditions with each condition likely requiring targeted therapeutic attention to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes.

26057107|t|Di- and triethanolamine grafted kaolinites of different structural order as adsorbents of heavy metals.
26057107|a|UNASSIGNED: Efficient sorbents based on widely available clay minerals are of particular value in the field of pollution control. The research shows mineral-based sorbents formed through organic modification of two kaolinites differing in structural order. Their structure and texture was characterized by XRD, FTIR, DTA/TG, CHN, XPS and N2 adsorption/desorption methods. The obtained materials were tested as adsorbents of Cd(II), Zn(II), Pb(II) and Cu(II) in equilibrium and kinetic experiments. Moreover, the sorption mechanisms were subjected to investigation. The synthesis procedure involved interlayer grafting of kaolinites with diethanolamine (DEA) and triethanolamine (TEA). The organo-kaolinites showed resistance to hydrolysis and temperature up to    300  C. The adsorption improvement was observed for the modified materials, particular the DEA derivatives and materials based on the poorly ordered kaolinite. The XPS analyses of elements local environment coupled with binding strength tests enabled to confirm the immobilization mechanisms. The pure kaolinites removed metal ions through either the ion-exchange or the surface complexation, exclusively on the external surfaces. In turn, the grafted materials additionally immobilized ions in the interlayer space which was expanded. The ions were attracted by the grafted DEA or TEA, which are N and O-donors and readily form complexes with metals, particularly with the Cu(II).

26057684|t|A Metrics Taxonomy and Reporting Strategy for Rule-Based Alerts.
26057684|a|CONTEXT: Because institutions rely on rule-based alerts as an important component of their safety and quality strategies, they should determine whether the alerts achieve the expected benefit. OBJECTIVE: To develop and to test a method of reporting outcome metrics for rule-based electronic health record alerts on a large scale. METHODS: We empirically developed an action-oriented alerts taxonomy according to structure, actions, and implicit intended process outcomes using a set of 333 rule-based alerts at Kaiser Permanente Northwest. Next we developed a method for producing metrics reports for alert classes. Finally, we applied this method to alert taxa. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were the successful development of a rule-based alerts taxonomy and the demonstration of its application in a reporting strategy. RESULTS: We identified 9 major and 17 overall classes of alerts. We developed a specific metric approach for 5 of these classes, including the 3 most numerous ones in our institution, accounting for 224 (67%) of our alerts. Some alert classes do not readily lend themselves to this approach. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a taxonomy for rule-based alerts and demonstrated its application in developing outcome metrics reports on a large scale. This information allows tuning or retiring alerts and may inform the need to develop complementary or alternative approaches to address organizational imperatives. A method that assigns alerts to classes each amenable to a particular reporting strategy could reduce the difficulty of producing metrics reports.

26056160|t|A Multifaceted GABAA Receptor Modulator: Functional Properties and Mechanism of Action of the Sedative-Hypnotic and Recreational Drug Methaqualone (Quaalude  ).
26056160|a|UNASSIGNED: In the present study we have elucidated the functional characteristics and mechanism of action of methaqualone (2-methyl-3-o-tolyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone, Quaalude  ), an infamous sedative-hypnotic and recreational drug from the 1960-70s. Methaqualone was demonstrated to be a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) at human a1,2,3,5b2,3y2S GABAA receptors (GABAARs) expressed in Xenopus oocytes, whereas it displayed highly diverse functionalities at the a4,6b1,2,3   GABAAR subtypes, ranging from inactivity (a4b1  ), through negative (a6b1  ) or positive allosteric modulation (a4b2  , a6b2,3  ), to superagonism (a4b3  ). Methaqualone did not interact with the benzodiazepine, barbiturate or neurosteroid binding sites in the GABAAR. Instead, the compound is proposed to act through the transmembrane b((+))/a((-)) subunit interface of the receptor, possibly targeting a site overlapping with that of the general anesthetic etomidate. The negligible activities displayed by methaqualone at numerous neurotransmitter receptors and transporters in an elaborate screening for additional putative CNS targets suggest that it is a selective GABAAR modulator. The mode of action of methaqualone was further investigated in multichannel recordings from primary frontal cortex networks, where the overall activity changes induced by the compound at 1-100  M concentrations were very similar to those mediated by other CNS depressants. Finally, the free methaqualone concentrations in mouse brain arising from doses producing significant in vivo effects in assays for locomotion and anticonvulsant activity were found to correlate fairly well with its potencies as a modulator at the recombinant GABAARs. Hence, we propose that the multifaceted functional properties exhibited by methaqualone at GABAARs give rise to its effects as a therapeutic and recreational drug.

26056111|t|Molecular typing of drug-susceptible and -resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Johannesburg, South Africa.
26056111|a|SETTING: Knowledge about spoligotyping families of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis circulating in the Johannesburg area, South Africa, is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To determine the genetic diversity of M. tuberculosis isolates circulating in the Johannesburg area and to compare the results with both national and international databanks. DESIGN: Five hundred cultured M. tuberculosis isolates from within the greater Johannesburg metropolitan area collected from January 2009 to December 2010 were obtained from the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) Mycobacteriology Referral Laboratory, Johannesburg, in MGIT vials. The isolates were specimens from individuals with tuberculosis (TB) symptoms and known TB patients submitted to the NHLS for routine mycobacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing. The isolates were genotyped using spoligotyping. RESULTS: Spoligotyping generated 62 shared types, with 92% (458/500) of the sample size matching pre-existing shared types. Of the 62 shared types, eight families were predominant (clustering from 16 to 132), representing 64% (340/500) of the sample. The Beijing family (135/500) predominated (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: TB incidence in Johannesburg does not appear to be due to clonality, but is rather due to diverse circulating strains, namely the Beijing family, followed by the S, Latin American-Mediterranean and T families.

26058038|t|Is temporal summation of pain and spinal nociception altered during normal aging?
26058038|a|UNASSIGNED: This study examines the effect of normal aging on temporal summation (TS) of pain and the nociceptive flexion reflex (RIII). Two groups of healthy volunteers, young and elderly, received transcutaneous electrical stimulation applied to the right sural nerve to assess pain and the nociceptive flexion reflex (RIII-reflex). Stimulus intensity was adjusted individually to 120% of RIII-reflex threshold and shocks were delivered as single stimulus or as series of five stimuli to assess TS at 5 different frequencies (0.17Hz, 0.33Hz, 0.66Hz, 1Hz and 2 Hz). This study shows that robust TS of pain and RIII-reflex is observable in individuals aged between 18 and 75 years-old and indicates that these effects are comparable between young and elder individuals. These results contrast with some previous findings and imply that at least some pain regulatory processes, including temporal summation, may not be affected by normal aging, although this may vary depending on the methodology.

26020111|t|Variation in Transfusion Practices and the Effect on Outcomes After Noncardiac Surgery.
26020111|a|OBJECTIVES: To identify the patient-level effects of blood transfusion on postoperative outcomes and to estimate the effects of different transfusion practices on hospital-level risk-adjusted outcomes. BACKGROUND: Postoperative transfusion practices and their effects on short-term outcomes in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery are not well understood. METHODS: Demographic, operative, and outcomes data for 48,720 patients undergoing general or vascular surgery at 52 hospitals between July 2012 and April 2014 were obtained. The main exposure variable was receipt of any blood transfusion within 72 hours after surgery. Thirty-day mortality, any morbidity, infectious complications, and postoperative myocardial infarction were the outcomes of interest. Propensity score matching was used to minimize confounding by indication. Hospitals were categorized as having a restrictive, average, or liberal transfusion practice based on average trigger hemoglobin values. RESULTS: A total of 2243 (4.6%) patients received a postoperative blood transfusion. After propensity matching, a postoperative transfusion was associated with increased 30-day mortality (3.6% excess absolute risk), any morbidity (4.4% excess absolute risk), and infectious morbidity (1.0% excess absolute risk). However, a transfusion was associated with 3.5% absolute risk reduction in postoperative myocardial infarction. At the hospital level, there was a wide variation in transfusion practices. Hospitals with liberal practices were twice as likely to transfuse patients and had higher risk-adjusted mortality rates than restrictive hospitals (3.1% vs 2.2%; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Postoperative transfusions after noncardiac surgery are associated with increased adverse postoperative outcomes, with the exception of postoperative myocardial infarction. Hospitals that are liberal in their transfusion practices have higher 30-day mortality rates, suggesting potential interventions for quality improvement.

26041767|t|Bag of Marbles controls the size and organization of the Drosophila hematopoietic niche through interactions with the Insulin-like growth factor pathway and Retinoblastoma-family protein.
26041767|a|UNASSIGNED: During Drosophila hematopoiesis, Bag of Marbles (Bam) is known to function as a positive regulator of hematopoietic progenitor maintenance in the lymph gland blood cell-forming organ. Here we demonstrate a key function for Bam in cells of the lymph gland posterior signaling center (PSC), a cellular domain proven to function as a hematopoietic niche. Bam is expressed in PSC cells and gene loss-of-function results in PSC overgrowth and disorganization, indicating Bam plays a crucial role in controlling the proper development of the niche. It was previously shown that Insulin receptor (InR) pathway signaling was essential for proper PSC cell proliferation. We analyzed PSC cell number in lymph glands that were double mutant for bam and InR pathway genes, and observed bam genetically interacts with pathway members in the formation of a normal PSC. The elF4A protein is a translation factor downstream of InR pathway signaling and functional knockdown of this critical regulator rescued the bam PSC overgrowth phenotype, further supporting the cooperative function of Bam with InR pathway members. Additionally, we documented the Retinoblastoma-family protein (Rbf), a proven regulator of cell proliferation, was present in cells of the PSC with this expression dependent on bam function. In contrast, perturbation of Decapentaplegic or Wingless signaling failed to affect Rbf niche cell expression. Together, these findings indicate InR pathway-Bam-Rbf functional interactions represent a newly identified means to regulate the correct size and organization of the PSC hematopoietic niche.

26054232|t|Death of a South American fur seal (Arctocephalus australis) after the ingestion of toads--evaluation of toad poisoning by toxicological analysis.
26054232|a|Animals in zoological gardens are at risk of severe and even lethal poisoning when they accidentally ingest toads. Here we report the case of an eleven month old male South American fur seal (Arctocephalus australis) which was found dead in its outdoor enclosure in the zoo of Dortmund, Germany. Autopsy revealed the presence of two adult, partly digested common toads (Bufo bufo) in the stomach. Toxicological analysis of the stomach content using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF MS) proved the presence of bufadienolides, the major cardiotoxic components of toad poisons. Using electrochemical luminescens immunoassay (ECLIA) compounds equivalent to digitoxin were detected in the blood sample confirming the absorption of toad poison components from the intestines into the circulation potentially leading to cardiac failure. In zoological gardens special precautions are necessary to protect non-native animals from encountering toads and the risk of poisoning, particularly in early spring, the spawning period of the toads.

26056172|t|DNA hairpins destabilize duplexes primarily by promoting melting rather than by inhibiting hybridization.
26056172|a|UNASSIGNED: The effect of secondary structure on DNA duplex formation is poorly understood. Using oxDNA, a nucleotide level coarse-grained model of DNA, we study how hairpins influence the rate and reaction pathways of DNA hybridzation. We compare to experimental systems studied by Gao et  al. (1) and find that 3-base pair hairpins reduce the hybridization rate by a factor of 2, and 4-base pair hairpins by a factor of 10, compared to DNA with limited secondary structure, which is in good agreement with experiments. By contrast, melting rates are accelerated by factors of    100 and    2000. This surprisingly large speed-up occurs because hairpins form during the melting process, and significantly lower the free energy barrier for dissociation. These results should assist experimentalists in designing sequences to be used in DNA nanotechnology, by putting limits on the suppression of hybridization reaction rates through the use of hairpins and offering the possibility of deliberately increasing dissociation rates by incorporating hairpins into single strands.

26055270|t|A review of the public-funded primary health care facilities for children in the pluralistic health care settings of Barbados, a Caribbean island.
26055270|a|UNASSIGNED: Aim The major objectives of this study were to evaluate the existing pediatrics health care service provisions and utilizations of the public polyclinics in Barbados. Furthermore, the aim was to assess if the existing manpower resources were adequate. BACKGROUND: Barbados has a mixed health care system consisting of both a socialized and a private health care system. The Ministry of Health commissioned a needs assessment survey of the pediatrics primary health care at the public polyclinics. METHODS: Primary data were collected through interviews with the public primary health care providers. Secondary data were collected from the Barbados Census Data and Ministry of Health statistics. Data were analyzed to assess the pediatrics primary health care service utilization and adequacy of existing resources at the polyclinics. Findings In 2012, there were 62 934 visits from children <16 years of age to the public polyclinics in Barbados and this accounted for 39.1% of all visits (both adults and children) to the polyclinics. An overall 16.7% of the visits were from children less than five years old to the Well Child Clinic for immunization and for growth and development monitoring; 32% of all physician consultations at the polyclinics were for children <16 years. Utilization of health services by children at the polyclinics was 5245 visits/month. Given an expected monthly demand for 10 822 visits from children, the polyclinics serve 48.5% of the primary health care demand for children in Barbados. CONCLUSIONS: The public polyclinics play a pivotal role in the pluralistic primary health care system in Barbados. They fulfill nearly half of all the primary care demand and more importantly provides for almost the entire immunization demand, and thereby ensuring high coverage. The existing resources, if used optimally, would reduce the long consultation time observed in this setting, and thereby increase the capacity considerably.

26097746|t|Diagnostic accuracy of three different MRI protocols in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
26097746|a|BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used for workup and control of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, disagreement remains as to how the MRI should be performed. PURPOSE: To compare prospectively the diagnostic accuracy of MRI with neither oral nor intravenous contrast medium (plain MRI), magnetic resonance follow-through (MRFT) and MR enteroclysis (MRE) using MRE as the reference standard in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plain MRI and MRE were carried out in addition to MRFT. All patients underwent both plain MR and MRFT on the same day and MRE within seven days. For the evaluation, the bowel was divided into nine segments. One radiologist, blinded to clinical findings, evaluated bowel wall thickness, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), mural hyperenhancement, and other inflammatory changes in each bowel segment. RESULTS: Twenty patients (6 men, 14 women; median age, 43.5 years; age range, 26-76 years) underwent all three examinations; 10 with Crohn's disease (CD), three with ulcerative colitis (UC), and seven with IBD unclassified (IBD-U). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were in the range of 0-75%, 81-96%, and 75-95% for wall thickening, and 0-37%, 59-89%, and 50-86% for DWI in plain MRI, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were in the range of 0-50%, 96-100%, and 90-100% for wall thickening, 0-50%, 84-97%, and 82-95% for DWI, and 0-71%, 94-100%, and 85-100% for mural hyperenhancement in MRFT, respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of oral and intravenous contrast agent improves detection of bowel lesions resulting in MRFT remaining the superior choice over plain MRI for diagnostic workup in patients with IBD.

26099012|t|Myocardial Sleeve Tissues in Surgical Lung Specimens.
26099012|a|UNASSIGNED: Left atrial myocardial extensions over the pulmonary veins (PVs), known as myocardial sleeves, are present in the physiological anatomy of most individuals. Although this structure has recently received clinical attention as a major origin of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), it has not been documented in surgical specimens. Here, we examine incidentally identified myocardial sleeve tissue in routinely processed lung resection specimens to determine its incidence and diagnostic implications. Among 694 lung resection specimens with evaluable PV margins, myocardial sleeve tissue was identified in 26 cases (3.7%). The tissue was located within the adventitia of the PVs, mostly in margin preparations, and existed outside the pericardium in the majority of cases. Carcinoma infiltration of the sleeves was evident in 6 cases. No heart injuries were observed, and no tumors invaded the heart. Preoperative electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm in all cases, whereas postoperative monitoring revealed sinus rhythm in all patients except one who showed AF and flutter. Myocardial sleeve tissue is an underrecognized incidental finding in lung resection specimens, and it is not indicative of heart injury. Cancer infiltration into this tissue indicates neither heart invasion nor, by itself, invasion into the pericardium. Although surgical transection of the myocardial sleeve did not evoke immediate arrhythmia in most cases, the overall influence of this procedure on the postsurgical risk of AF remains to be determined in further studies involving extensive rhythm assessment.

26097460|t|Social justice in education: how the function of selection in educational institutions predicts support for (non)egalitarian assessment practices.
26097460|a|UNASSIGNED: Educational institutions are considered a keystone for the establishment of a meritocratic society. They supposedly serve two functions: an educational function that promotes learning for all, and a selection function that sorts individuals into different programs, and ultimately social positions, based on individual merit. We study how the function of selection relates to support for assessment practices known to harm vs. benefit lower status students, through the perceived justice principles underlying these practices. We study two assessment practices: normative assessment-focused on ranking and social comparison, known to hinder the success of lower status students-and formative assessment-focused on learning and improvement, known to benefit lower status students. Normative assessment is usually perceived as relying on an equity principle, with rewards being allocated based on merit and should thus appear as positively associated with the function of selection. Formative assessment is usually perceived as relying on corrective justice that aims to ensure equality of outcomes by considering students' needs, which makes it less suitable for the function of selection. A questionnaire measuring these constructs was administered to university students. Results showed that believing that education is intended to select the best students positively predicts support for normative assessment, through increased perception of its reliance on equity, and negatively predicts support for formative assessment, through reduced perception of its ability to establish corrective justice. This study suggests that the belief in the function of selection as inherent to educational institutions can contribute to the reproduction of social inequalities by preventing change from assessment practices known to disadvantage lower-status student, namely normative assessment, to more favorable practices, namely formative assessment, and by promoting matching beliefs in justice principles.

26096940|t|Meiotic wave adds extra asymmetry to the development of female chicken gonads.
26096940|a|UNASSIGNED: Development of female gonads in chicken is asymmetric. This asymmetry affects gene expression, morphology, and germ cell development; consequently only the left ovary develops into a functional organ, whereas the right ovary remains vestigial. In males, on the other hand, both gonads develop into functional testes. Here, we revisited the development of asymmetric traits in female (and male) chicken gonads between Hamburger Hamilton stage 16 (HH16) and hatching. At HH16, primordial germ cells migrated preferentially to the left gonad, accumulating in the left coelomic hinge between the gut mesentery and developing gonad in both males and females. Using the meiotic markers SYCP3 and phosphorylated H2AFX, we identified a previously undescribed, pronounced asymmetry to meiotic progression in the germ cells located in the central, lateral, and extreme cortical regions of the left female gonad from HH38 until hatching. Moreover, we observed that -in contrast to the current view- medullary germ cells are not apoptotic, but remain arrested in pre-leptotene until hatching. In addition to the systematic analysis of the asymmetric distribution of germ cells in female chicken gonads, we propose an updated model suggesting that the localization of germ cells -in the left or right gonad; in the cortex or medulla of the left gonad; and in the central part or the extremities of the left cortex- has direct consequences for their development and participation in adult reproduction.

26094928|t|A Comparison of Sleep Difficulties among Iraq/Afghanistan Theater Veterans with and without Mental Health Diagnoses.
26094928|a|STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep disturbance is among the most common complaints of veterans and military personnel who deployed to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. A growing body of research has examined cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between sleep disturbance and mental health symptoms and specific diagnoses in this population. However, prior research has not examined these relationships in terms of the presence or absence of any mental health diagnosis. The objective of the current study is to characterize the sleep complaints (sleep characteristics, sleep quality, insomnia symptoms, and distressing dreams and nightmares) of previously deployed military personnel in terms of the presence or absence of a mental health disorder, diagnosed using structured clinical diagnostic interviews. METHODS: Participants (N = 1,238) were veterans and active duty military personnel serving in the military since September 11, 2001, and deployed at least once. Scale scores and item-level data from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the PSQI-Addendum, the Davidson Trauma Scale, and the Symptom Checklist-90 were used to compare sleep across mental health status (with/without mental health disorder). RESULTS: As expected, self-reported sleep impairments were worse among those meeting criteria for a mental health disorder. However, findings also revealed very poor sleep among those without a mental health diagnosis as well. Mean values for both groups were suggestive of short sleep duration, low sleep efficiency, long sleep onset latencies, poor sleep quality, frequent insomnia symptoms, and nightmare frequencies that are well above norms for the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Given the evidence for adverse mental and physical health sequelae of untreated sleep disturbance, increased attention to sleep in this population may serve as a primary prevention strategy.

26098961|t|Positive Association of Fibroadenomatoid Change with HER2-Negative Invasive Breast Cancer: A Co-Occurrence Study.
26098961|a|BACKGROUND: Risk assessment of a benign breast disease/lesion (BBD) for invasive breast cancer (IBC) is typically done through a longitudinal study. For an infrequently-reported BBD, the shortage of occurrence data alone is a limiting factor to conducting such a study. Here we present an approach based on co-occurrence analysis, to help address this issue. We focus on fibroadenomatoid change (FAC), an under-studied BBD, as our preliminary analysis has suggested its previously unknown significant co-occurrence with IBC. METHODS: A cohort of 1667 female patients enrolled in the Clinical Breast Care Project was identified. A single experienced breast pathologist reviewed all pathology slides for each case and recorded all observed lesions, including FAC. Fibroadenoma (FA) was studied for comparison since FAC had been speculated to be an immature FA. FA and Fibrocystic Changes (FCC) were used for method validation since they have been comprehensively studied. Six common IBC and BBD risk/protective factors were also studied. Co-occurrence analyses were performed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Common risk/protective factors were associated with FA, FCC, and IBC in ways consistent with the literature in general, and they were associated with FAC, FA, and FCC in distinct patterns. Age was associated with FAC in a bell-shape curve so that middle-aged women were more likely to have FAC. We report for the first time that FAC is positively associated with IBC with odds ratio (OR) depending on BMI (OR = 6.78, 95%CI = 3.43-13.42 at BMI<25 kg/m2; OR = 2.13, 95%CI = 1.20-3.80 at BMI>25 kg/m2). This association is only significant with HER2-negative IBC subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that FAC is a candidate risk factor for HER2-negative IBCs, and it is a distinct disease from FA. Co-occurrence analysis can be used for initial assessment of the risk for IBC from a BBD, which is vital to the study of infrequently-reported BBDs.

26069101|t|Identification of miR-199a-5p in serum as noninvasive biomarkers for detecting and monitoring osteosarcoma.
26069101|a|UNASSIGNED: Emerging evidence has suggested that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in serum/plasma can serve as noninvasive biomarkers for cancer detection; however, little is known about circulating miRNA profiles in osteosarcoma, a primary malignant bone tumor with high morbidity in young adults and adolescents. The objective of this study was to investigate whether circulating miRNAs in serum could be a useful biomarker for detecting osteosarcoma and monitoring tumor dynamics. Serum samples were obtained from 60 patients before surgery, 28 patients after 1 month of surgery, and 60 healthy individuals. The study was divided into three steps: (1) initial screening of the profiles of circulating miRNAs in pooled serum samples from both healthy controls and pre- and postoperative osteosarcoma patients using a TaqMan low-density qPCR array (TLDA); (2) evaluation of miRNA concentration in individual serum samples from 60 preoperative osteosarcoma patients and 60 healthy controls by a quantitative RT-PCR assay; and (3) evaluation of miRNA concentration in paired serum samples from 28 pre- and postoperative osteosarcoma patients by a quantitative RT-PCR assay. The initial analysis showed that concentrations of serum miRNAs were significantly altered between preoperative osteosarcoma patients and healthy controls and between pre- and postoperative osteosarcoma patients. The quantitative RT-PCR assay showed that serum miR-199a-5p concentrations were significantly higher in osteosarcoma patients than in controls. The value of the area under the ROC curve was 0.8606. Serum levels of miR-199a-5p were significantly lower in post- than preoperative samples. The results indicated the potential of circulating miRNAs as novel noninvasive biomarkers for detecting and monitoring osteosarcoma.

26030952|t|[Progress assessment of rehabilitation in patients after hip replacement. Preliminary report].
26030952|a|INTRODUCTION: Coxarthrosis is one of the most common diseases of the motor system. We distinguish primary and secondary coxarthrosis. The premises for total hip replacement include pain, damage to the surface of the acetabulum and the head of the hip, relative shortening of the limb, gluteal, femur and crus muscle atrophy and gait dysfunctions. The aim of this paper is to present the influence of rehabilitation on the improvement of physical ability, especially in respect to quality of gait and antianalgesic efficacy of the physical therapy in patients after total hip replacement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out in 37 patients aged 35-72 (mean of age--53.78 +/- 9.92). The group consisted'of 21 women and 16 men. After the total hip replacement, all the patients underwent physical therapy which involved application of laser radiation on the postoperative scar, whirpool and classic massage of the operated limb, exercises in non-weight bearing and weight-bearing exercises and gait reeducation. Modified Laitinen Pain Indicator Questionnaire, Visual Analogue Scale-VAS and the standardized mobility test--Timed-Up-And-Go test were used in the study. The statistical analysis was carried out with the use of the STATYSTIKA 5 PL computer program. RESULTS: The results reached point to the analgesic efficacy of the physical therapy and a better gait quality. CONCLUSIONS: Multifactor physical therapy after total hip replacement shows analgesic action. Appropriate selection of exercises and physical treatment have positive influence on gait reeducation in patients after total hip replacement. The Timed Up and Go test may be used in functional assessment of gait in patients with musculoskeletal disorders.

26063233|t|Analyzing dendritic spine pathology in Alzheimer's disease: problems and opportunities.
26063233|a|Synaptic failure is an immediate cause of cognitive decline and memory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. Dendritic spines are specialized structures on neuronal processes, on which excitatory synaptic contacts take place and the loss of dendritic spines directly correlates with the loss of synaptic function. Dendritic spines are readily accessible for both in vitro and in vivo experiments and have, therefore, been studied in great detail in Alzheimer's disease mouse models. To date, a large number of different mechanisms have been proposed to cause dendritic spine dysfunction and loss in Alzheimer's disease. For instance, amyloid beta fibrils, diffusible oligomers or the intracellular accumulation of amyloid beta have been found to alter the function and structure of dendritic spines by distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, tau hyperphosphorylation and microglia activation, which are thought to be consequences of amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease, may also contribute to spine loss. Lastly, genetic and therapeutic interventions employed to model the disease and elucidate its pathogenetic mechanisms in experimental animals may cause alterations of dendritic spines on their own. However, to date none of these mechanisms have been translated into successful therapeutic approaches for the human disease. Here, we critically review the most intensely studied mechanisms of spine loss in Alzheimer's disease as well as the possible pitfalls inherent in the animal models of such a complex neurodegenerative disorder.

26065003|t|Significant Depletion of CD4(+) T Cells Occurs in the Oral Mucosa during Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Infection with the Infected CD4(+) T Cell Reservoir Continuing to Persist in the Oral Mucosa during Antiretroviral Therapy.
26065003|a|Human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV and SIV) infections are characterized by manifestation of numerous opportunistic infections and inflammatory conditions in the oral mucosa. The loss of CD4(+) T cells that play a critical role in maintaining mucosal immunity likely contributes to this process. Here we show that CD4(+) T cells constitute a minor population of T cells in the oral mucosa and display a predominantly central memory phenotype mirroring other mucosal sites such as the rectal mucosa. Chronic SIV infection was associated with a near total depletion of CD4(+) T cells in the oral mucosa that appear to repopulate during antiretroviral therapy (ART). Repopulating CD4(+) T cells harbored a large fraction of Th17 cells suggesting that ART potentially reconstitutes oral mucosal immunity. However, a minor fraction of repopulating CD4(+) T cells harbored SIV DNA suggesting that the viral reservoir continues to persist in the oral mucosa during ART. Therapeutic approaches aimed at obtaining sustainable CD4(+) T cell repopulation in combination with strategies that can eradicate the latent viral reservoir in the oral mucosa are essential for better oral health and long-term outcome in HIV infected patients.

26067770|t|Long-term outcome of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization after radiofrequency ablation as a combined therapy for Chinese Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
26067770|a|UNASSIGNED: Objective This study was undertaken to assess the long-term outcome of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with as a combined therapy for Chinese patients with intermediate (stage B) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of single block type, and evaluate the survival rate for 1,3,5, and 7 years. Research design and methods This prospective, single-center study consisted patients with solitary massive intermediate (stage B) HCC treated by RFA combined with TACE from October 1999 to December 2013. Main outcome measures We evaluated the survival rate of the patients for 1, 3, 5, and 7 years, and safety of the RFA treatment in the interim, total RFA for each case, and number of TACE cycles. Results Ninety-three patients (aged, 54.4    8.0 years) underwent RFA combined with TACE as a combined therapy, and they were analyzed and followed up until December 2013. The mean time for the initial ablation was 1.5 to 3 hours, and on an average each patient received 1.39 RFA and 1.43 TACE therapies. Overall, complete ablation was achieved in 9 patients, and the majority of ablation was seen in 84 patients. The longest survival time was 102 months, and among the survivors the 1, 3, 5 and 7 year survival rate was 94.4%, 52.3%, 26.1%, and 14.1%, respectively. The median survival time was 36 months (95% confidence interval: 32.7-39.3). Serum AFP levels showed significant correlation with tumor size in patients with HCC. (r=0.323, 0.0001). There were no major complications related to this therapy. Conclusion This was the first study that performed RFA combined with TACE in Chinese patients with intermediate (stage B) HCC. RFA combined with TACE, as a combined therapy for intermediate (stage B) HCC seems to be a promising regimen that showed a satisfactory clinical effect, which may become a new therapy mode for HCC. However, a larger cohort and control group(s) reflecting usual standards of care are needed to assess the external validity of these results in a wider population.

26068445|t|Abscisic acid induces ectopic outgrowth in epidermal cells through cortical microtubule reorganization in Arabidopsis thaliana.
26068445|a|Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates seed maturation, germination and various stress responses in plants. The roles of ABA in cellular growth and morphogenesis, however, remain to be explored. Here, we report that ABA induces the ectopic outgrowth of epidermal cells in Arabidopsis thaliana. Seedlings of A. thaliana germinated and grown in the presence of ABA developed ectopic protrusions in the epidermal cells of hypocotyls, petioles and cotyledons. One protrusion was formed in the middle of each epidermal cell. In the hypocotyl epidermis, two types of cell files are arranged alternately into non-stoma cell files and stoma cell files, ectopic protrusions being restricted to the non-stoma cell files. This suggests the presence of a difference in the degree of sensitivity to ABA or in the capacity of cells to form protrusions between the two cell files. The ectopic outgrowth was suppressed in ABA insensitive mutants, whereas it was enhanced in ABA hypersensitive mutants. Interestingly, ABA-induced ectopic outgrowth was also suppressed in mutants in which microtubule organization was compromised. Furthermore, cortical microtubules were disorganized and depolymerized by the ABA treatment. These results suggest that ABA signaling induces ectopic outgrowth in epidermal cells through microtubule reorganization.

26068107|t|Childhood Adversity Is Associated with Adult Theory of Mind and Social Affiliation, but Not Face Processing.
26068107|a|People vary substantially in their ability to acquire and maintain social ties. Here, we use a combined epidemiological and individual differences approach to understand the childhood roots of adult social cognitive functioning. We assessed exposure to 25 forms of traumatic childhood experiences in over 5000 adults, along with measures of face discrimination, face memory, theory of mind, social motivation, and social support. Retrospectively-reported experiences of parental maltreatment in childhood (particularly physical abuse) were the most broadly and robustly associated with adult variations in theory of mind, social motivation, and social support. Adult variations in face discrimination and face memory, on the other hand, were not significantly associated with exposure to childhood adversity. Our findings indicate domains of social cognition that may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of adverse childhood environments, and suggest mechanisms whereby environmental factors might influence the development of social abilities.

26071170|t|Osteoporosis and Silent Vertebral Fractures in Nursing Home Resident Elderly Men in Turkey.
26071170|a|UNASSIGNED: Osteoporosis is an important cause of vertebral fractures and there is an increased risk for osteoporosis in nursing home residents. Most of the men with osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures are not diagnosed and do not receive treatment. Our study aim was to determine osteoporosis and silent vertebral fracture prevalence in male nursing home residents in Corum, Turkey. This cross-sectional study included 2 groups of patients: 71 male nursing home residents (nursing home group) with a mean age of 76.0    0.8  years and 44 men living in their own homes (control group) with a mean age of 74.4    0.7  years. Bone mineral densitometry was performed in all subjects, and results were evaluated according to the World Health Organization criteria. Vertebral deformity was evaluated using the spinal deformity index, and fracture risk was calculated using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool. In all participants, serum calcium, phosphorus, 25 (OH) vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphates levels were measured and medical histories were recorded. Osteoporosis was detected in 25.3% of men residing in nursing homes and in 8.8% of men living in their own homes. Silent vertebral fracture was present in 27.8% of patients older than 65 years. Vertebral fracture rate was higher in nursing home residents (42.2%) than men living in their own homes (17.6%); 5.6% of nursing home group and 8.9% of control group patients were aware of their fractures. Our results demonstrated that male nursing home residents are at a higher risk for both osteoporosis and vertebral fractures compared to the men living in their own homes.

26065867|t|Management of Diabetic Complications through Fruit Flavonoids as a Natural Remedy.
26065867|a|UNASSIGNED: Diabetes mellitus is a global disorder, and a major issue for health care systems. The current review outlooks the use of fruit flavonoids as natural remedy in the prevention of diabetes mellitus. The onset of diabetes mainly depends upon genetics and lifestyle issues. Currently used therapeutic options for the control of diabetes, like dietary amendments, oral hypoglycemic drugs, and insulin have their own limitations. Fruit flavonoids possess various anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potentials and act on various cellular signaling pathways in pancreas, white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver function, which in result induces antidiabetic effects. Recently, antidiabetic effect of fruit flavonoids has been studied using various animal models and clinical trials. Research studies revealed a statistically significant potential of fruit flavonoids in managing the altered glucose and oxidative metabolisms in diabetes. Unlike synthetic anti-diabetic agents, fruit flavonoids manage diabetes without compromising cellular homeostasis thereby posing no side effects. Further studies are required in purification and characterization of different fruit flavonoids with respect to their beneficial effect for diabetic patients.

26062611|t|Beware of Data Gaps in Home Care Research: The Streetlight Effect and Its Implications for Policy Making on Long-Term Services and Supports.
26062611|a|UNASSIGNED: Policy initiatives increasingly seek greater use of home- and community-based services for older persons and those with chronic care needs, yet large gaps persist in our knowledge of home care, an indispensable component of long-term services and supports. Unrecognized data gaps, including the scope of home care provided by private hire and nonmedical providers, can distort knowledge and poorly inform long-term services and supports policy. The purpose of this article is to examine these gaps by describing the universe of formal home care services and provider types in relationship to major national sources. Findings reveal four distinct home care sectors and that the majority of formal home care is provided in the sectors that are understudied. We discuss the policy implications of data gaps and conclude with recommendations on where to expand and refine home care research.

26017275|t|Enhanced surveillance and data feedback loop associated with improved malaria data in Lusaka, Zambia.
26017275|a|BACKGROUND: Accurate and timely malaria data are crucial to monitor the progress towards and attainment of elimination. Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia, has reported very low malaria prevalence in Malaria Indicator Surveys. Issues of low malaria testing rates, high numbers of unconfirmed malaria cases and over consumption of anti-malarials were common at clinics within Lusaka, however. The Government of Zambia (GRZ) and its partners sought to address these issues through an enhanced surveillance and feedback programme at clinic level. METHODS: The enhanced malaria surveillance programme began in 2011 to verify trends in reported malaria, as well as to implement a data feedback loop to improve data uptake, use, and quality. A process of monthly data collection and provision of feedback was implemented within all GRZ health clinics in Lusaka District. During clinic visits, clinic registers were accessed to record the number of reported malaria cases, malaria test positivity rate, malaria testing rate, and proportion of total suspected malaria that was confirmed with a diagnostic test. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Following the enhanced surveillance programme, the odds of receiving a diagnostic test for a suspected malaria case increased (OR   =   1.54, 95  % CI   =   0.96-2.49) followed by an upward monthly trend (OR   =   1.05, 95  % CI   =   1.01-1.09). The odds of a reported malaria case being diagnostically confirmed also increased monthly (1.09, 95  % CI 1.04-1.15). After an initial 140  % increase (95  % CI   =   91-183  %), costs fell by 11  % each month (95  % CI   =   5.7-10.9  %). Although the mean testing rate increased from 18.9 to 64.4  % over the time period, the proportion of reported malaria unconfirmed by diagnostic remained high at 76  %. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced surveillance and implementation of a data feedback loop have substantially increased malaria testing rates and decreased the number of unconfirmed malaria cases and courses of ACT consumed in Lusaka District within just two years. Continued support of enhanced surveillance in Lusaka as well as national scale-up of the system is recommended to reinforce good case management and to ensure timely, reliable data are available to guide targeting of limited malaria prevention and control resources in Zambia.

26017522|t|Migraine and lifestyle in childhood.
26017522|a|UNASSIGNED: Migraine is one of the most frequently reported somatic complaints in childhood, with a negative impact on health-related quality of life. The incidence of migraine in childhood has substantially increased over the past 30  years, probably due to both increased awareness of the disease and lifestyle changes in this age group. Indeed, several conditions have been identified as risk factors for migraine in childhood. Amongst these, dysfunctional family situation, the regular consumption of alcohol, caffeine ingestion, low level of physical activity, physical or emotional abuse, bullying by peers, unfair treatment in school and insufficient leisure time seem to play a critical role. Nevertheless, there are only few studies about the association between migraine and lifestyle in childhood, due to previous observations specifically focused on "headache" in children. In this brief review, we will concentrate upon recent studies aimed to explore migraine and lifestyle risk factors in childhood.

26058451|t|Low-memory iterative density fitting.
26058451|a|UNASSIGNED: A new low-memory modification of the density fitting approximation based on a combination of a continuous fast multipole method (CFMM) and a preconditioned conjugate gradient solver is presented. Iterative conjugate gradient solver uses preconditioners formed from blocks of the Coulomb metric matrix that decrease the number of iterations needed for convergence by up to one order of magnitude. The matrix-vector products needed within the iterative algorithm are calculated using CFMM, which evaluates them with the linear scaling memory requirements only. Compared with the standard density fitting implementation, up to 15-fold reduction of the memory requirements is achieved for the most efficient preconditioner at a cost of only 25% increase in computational time. The potential of the method is demonstrated by performing density functional theory calculations for zeolite fragment with 2592 atoms and 121,248 auxiliary basis functions on a single 12-core CPU workstation.    2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

26016797|t|Utilization of research findings for health policy making and practice: evidence from three case studies in Bangladesh.
26016797|a|BACKGROUND: In striving to contribute towards improved health outcomes, health research institutions generate and accumulate huge volumes of relevant but often underutilized data. This study explores activities undertaken by researchers from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), an international research institution that promotes the utilization of their findings in the policymaking processes in Bangladesh. METHODS: The study used an exploratory case study design and employed qualitative methods to explore activities implemented to promote research utilization and the extent to which researchers felt that their findings contributed to the policymaking process. Data were collected between September and December 2011 through key informant interviews, focus group discussions with study investigators, and database and document reviews. We reviewed findings from 19 reproductive health studies conducted and completed by icddr,b researchers between 2001 and 2011. We interviewed 21 key informants, including 13 researchers, two policy makers, and six programme implementers. Data were entered into Microsoft Word and analyzed manually following a thematic framework approach. Following the World Health Organization/Turning Research into Practice (WHO/TRIP) framework, three case studies of how research findings were utilized in the policymaking processes in Bangladesh were documented. RESULTS: Activities implemented to promote research utilization included conducting dissemination workshops, publishing scientific papers, developing policy briefs, providing technical assistance to policymakers and programme implementers, holding one-on-one meetings, and joining advocacy networks. The majority of the researchers (12 of 13) reported that their study findings were utilized to influence policymaking processes at different levels. However, some researchers reported being unaware of whether and how their findings were utilized. As regards actual utilization of research findings, the evidence from the three case studies indicate that research findings can be utilized instrumentally, conceptually and symbolically, and at different stages within the policymaking process, including agenda setting and policy formulation and implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that research findings from icddr,b were promoted and utilized in health policymaking processes in Bangladesh using a variety of utilization approaches. These results suggest a need for using multiple approaches to promote utilization of research findings in health policymaking processes.

26029299|a|Traumatic self-amputation of the penis by a psychotic patient is rare. Microvascular replantation is the favored management approach. There are no known cases of self-amputation followed by ingestion of the stump and subsequent replantation. A 51-year-old patient with paranoid schizophrenia presented 2 hours following penile amputation. He had swallowed the excised portion, which was endoscopically retrieved from the stomach in the emergency department. Successful reattachment was achieved including microvascular repair of the dorsal penile arteries without cavernosal arterial anastamoses. A Winter's shunt was performed to improve venous circulation. The patient has been followed for 3 years from the date of repair. He has adequate erection for intercourse and good urinary function, but has experienced sensory loss over the dorsal aspect and glans and urethral stricture dilation. This is the first report of replantation following ingestion of an amputated penis.

26030137|t|Helmet-Wearing Practices and Barriers in Toronto Bike-Share Users: a Case-Control Study.
26030137|a|BACKGROUND: Helmet use among bike-share users is low. We sought to characterize helmet-use patterns, barriers to helmet use, and cycling safety practices among bike-share users in Toronto. METHODS: A standardized survey of public bike-share program (PBSP) users at semi-random distribution of PBSP stations was undertaken. By maintaining a ratio of one helmet-wearer (HW): two non-helmet-wearers (NHW) per survey period, we controlled for location, day, time, and weather. RESULTS: Surveys were completed on 545 (180 HW, 365 NHW) unique users at 48/80 PBSP locations, from November 2012 to August 2013. More females wore helmets (F: 41.1%, M: 30.9%, p=0.0423). NHWs were slightly younger than HWs (NHW mean age 34.4 years vs HW 37.3, p=0.0018). The groups did not differ by employment status, education, or income. Helmet ownership was lower among NHWs (NHW: 62.4% vs HW: 99.4%, p<0.0001), as was personal bike ownership (NHW: 65.8%, vs HW: 78.3%, p=0.0026). NHWs were less likely to always wear a helmet on personal bikes (NHW: 22.2% vs HW: 66.7%, p<0.0001), and less likely to wear a helmet always or most of the time on PBSP (NHW: 5.8% vs HW: 92.3%, p<0.0001). Both groups, but more HWs, had planned to use PBSP when leaving their houses (HW: 97.2% vs NHW: 85.2%, p<0.0001), primarily to get to work (HW: 88.3% vs NHW: 84.1%, p=0.19). NHWs were more likely to report that they would wear a helmet more (NHW: 61.4% vs HW: 13.9%, p<0.0001), and/or cycle less (NHW: 22.5% vs HW: 4.4%) if helmet use was mandatory. CONCLUSIONS: PBSP users surveyed appear to make deliberate decisions regarding helmet use. NHWs tended to be male, slightly younger, and less likely to use helmets on their personal bikes. As Toronto cyclists who do not wear helmets on PBSP generally do not wear helmets on their personal bikes, interventions to increase helmet use should target both personal and bike-share users. Legislating helmet use and provision of rental helmets could improve helmet use among bike-share users, but our results suggest some risk of reduced cycling with legislation.

26027434|t|Deleting the BAFF receptor TACI protects against systemic lupus erythematosus without extensive reduction of B cell numbers.
26027434|a|UNASSIGNED: B cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF) is an essential B cell survival factor. However, high levels of BAFF promote systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in mice and humans. Belimumab (anti-human BAFF) limits B cell survival and is approved for use in patients with SLE. Surprisingly, the efficacy of rituximab (anti-human CD20) in SLE remains controversial, despite depleting B cells more potently than belimumab. This raises the question of whether B cell depletion is really the mechanism of action of belimumab. In BAFF transgenic mice, SLE development is T cell-independent but relies on innate activation of B cells via TLRs, and TLR expression is modulated by the BAFF receptor TACI. Here, we show that loss of TACI on B cells protected against BAFF-mediated autoimmune manifestations while preserving B cells, suggesting that loss of BAFF signaling through TACI rather than loss of B cells may underpin the effect of belimumab in the clinic. Therefore, B cell-sparing blockade of TACI may offer a more specific and safer therapeutic alternative to broad B cell depletion in SLE.

CD133 promotes tumorigenesis partly through an interaction between its phosphorylated Y828 residue and the PI3K regulatory subunit p85, and the interaction with b-catenin. Although CD133 glycosylation is supposed to be associated with its function, the contribution of N-glycosylation to its functions remains unclear. Here we analyzed the exact site(s) of N-glycosylation in CD133 by mass spectrometry and found that all eight potential N-glycosylation sites of CD133 could be indeed occupied by N-glycans. Loss of individual N-glycosylation sites had no effect on the level of expression or membrane localization of CD133. However, mutation at glycosylation site Asn548 significantly decreased the ability of CD133 to promote hepatoma cell growth. Furthermore, mutation of Asn548 reduced the interaction between CD133 and b-catenin and inhibited the activation of b-catenin signaling by CD133 overexpression. Our results identified the characteristics and function of CD133 glycosylation sites. These data could potentially shed light on molecular regulation of CD133 by glycosylation and enhance our understanding of the utility of glycosylated CD133 as a target for cancer therapies.

26045273|t|Impact of Inhibiting Ileal Apical versus Basolateral Bile Acid Transport on Cholesterol Metabolism and Atherosclerosis in Mice.
26045273|a|BACKGROUND: Bile acid sequestrants have been used for many years to treat hypercholesterolemia by increasing hepatic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, thereby inducing hepatic LDL receptor expression and clearance of apoB-containing particles. In order to further understand the underlying molecular mechanisms linking gut-liver signaling and cholesterol homeostasis, mouse models defective in ileal apical membrane bile acid transport (Asbt-null) and ileal basolateral membrane bile acid transport (Osta-null) were studied under basal and hypercholesterolemic conditions. Key Messages: Hepatic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids is the major pathway for cholesterol catabolism and a major mechanism for cholesterol elimination. Blocking ileal apical membrane bile acid transport (Asbt-null mice) increases fecal bile acid excretion, hepatic Cyp7a1 expression, and the relative proportion of taurocholate in the bile acid pool, but decreases ileal FGF15 expression, bile acid pool size, and hepatic cholesterol content. In contrast, blocking ileal basolateral membrane bile acid transport (Osta-null mice) increases ileal FGF15 expression, reduces hepatic Cyp7a1 expression, and increases the proportion of tauro-b-muricholic acid in the bile acid pool. In the hypercholesterolemic apoE-null background, plasma cholesterol levels and measurements of atherosclerosis were reduced in Asbt/apoE-null mice, but not in Osta/apoE-null mice. CONCLUSIONS: Blocking the intestinal absorption of bile acids at the apical versus basolateral membrane differentially affects bile acid and cholesterol metabolism, including the development of hypercholesterolemia-associated atherosclerosis. The molecular mechanism likely involves an altered regulation of ileal FGF15 expression.    2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

26045858|t|Toxoplasmosis presented as a submental mass: a common disease, uncommon presentation.
26045858|a|Submental mass secondary to toxoplasmosis is not common in clinical work. A diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is rarely considered by physicians. Here we describe a 50-year-old woman presented with a progressive, painful, submental and left neck swelling for 1 month. After having obtained an insufficient evidence from the fine-needle biopsy, the patient finally received an excisional biopsy which highly indicated the possibility of lymphadenopathy consistent with toxoplasmosis. Diagnosis of toxoplasmosis was finally established by a combination of the pathological criteria, together with the positive serological finding. According to review the clinical presentations, pathological characteristics, diagnostic standard and treatment of this disease, the article aims to remind otolaryngologists who are evaluating a neck mass should be aware of the infectious cause of lymphadenopathy and the possibility of toxoplasmosis.

26037826|t|The enigma of effective pathlength for (18) O enrichment in leaf water of conifers.
26037826|a|UNASSIGNED: The P  clet correction is often used to predict leaf evaporative enrichment and requires an estimate of effective pathlength (L). Studies to estimate L in conifer needles have produced unexpected patterns based on P  clet theory and leaf anatomy. We exposed seedlings of six conifer species to different vapor pressure deficits (VPD) in controlled climate chambers to produce steady-state leaf water enrichment (in (18) O). We measured leaf gas exchange, stable oxygen isotopic composition (  (18) O) of input and plant waters as well as leaf anatomical characteristics. Variation in bulk needle water   (18) O was strongly related to VPD. Conifer needles had large amounts of water within the vascular strand that was potentially unenriched (up to 40%). Both standard Craig-Gordon and P  clet models failed to accurately predict conifer leaf water   (18) O without taking into consideration the unenriched water in the vascular strand and variable L. Although L was linearly related to mesophyll thickness, large within-species variation prevented the development of generalizations that could allow a broader use of the P  clet effect in predictive models. Our results point to the importance of within needle water pools and isolating mechanisms that need further investigation in order to integrate P  clet corrections with "two compartment" leaf water concepts.

26033870|t|Breaking the cycle: future faculty begin teaching with learner-centered strategies after professional development.
26033870|a|The availability of reliable evidence for teaching practices after professional development is limited across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines, making the identification of professional development "best practices" and effective models for change difficult. We aimed to determine the extent to which postdoctoral fellows (i.e., future biology faculty) believed in and implemented evidence-based pedagogies after completion of a 2-yr professional development program, Faculty Institutes for Reforming Science Teaching (FIRST IV). Postdocs (PDs) attended a 2-yr training program during which they completed self-report assessments of their beliefs about teaching and gains in pedagogical knowledge and experience, and they provided copies of class assessments and video recordings of their teaching. The PDs reported greater use of learner-centered compared with teacher-centered strategies. These data were consistent with the results of expert reviews of teaching videos. The majority of PDs (86%) received video ratings that documented active engagement of students and implementation of learner-centered classrooms. Despite practice of higher-level cognition in class sessions, the items used by the PDs on their assessments of learning focused on lower-level cognitive skills. We attributed the high success of the FIRST IV program to our focus on inexperienced teachers, an iterative process of teaching practice and reflection, and development of and teaching a full course.

26031394|t|Travel Medicine Encounters of Australian General Practice Trainees-A Cross-Sectional Study.
26031394|a|BACKGROUND: Travel medicine is a common and challenging area of clinical practice and practitioners need up-to-date knowledge and experience in a range of areas. Australian general practitioners (GPs) play a significant role in the delivery of travel medicine advice. We aimed to describe the rate and nature of travel medicine consultations, including both the clinical and educational aspects of the consultations. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis from an ongoing cohort study of GP trainees' clinical consultations was performed. Trainees contemporaneously recorded demographic, clinical, and educational details of consecutive patient consultations. Proportions of all problems/diagnoses managed in these consultations that were coded "travel-related" and "travel advice" were both calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Associations of a problem/diagnosis being "travel-related" or "travel advice" were tested using simple logistic regression within the generalized estimating equations (GEE) framework. RESULTS: A total of 856 trainees contributed data on 169,307 problems from 108,759 consultations (2010-2014). Travel-related and travel advice problems were managed at a rate of 1.1 and 0.5 problems per 100 encounters, respectively. Significant positive associations of travel-related problems were younger trainee and patient age; new patient to the trainee and practice; privately billing, larger, urban, and higher socioeconomic status practices; and involvement of the practice nurse. Trainees sought in-consultation information and generated learning goals in 34.7 and 20.8% of travel advice problems, respectively, significantly more than in non-travel advice problems. Significant positive associations of travel advice problems were seeking in-consultation information, generation of learning goals, longer consultation duration, and more problems managed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reinforce the importance of focused training in travel medicine for GP trainees and adequate exposure to patients in the practice setting. In addition, our findings have implications more broadly for the delivery of travel medicine in general practice.

26035357|t|Epigenetic and oncogenic regulation of SLC16A7 (MCT2) results in protein over-expression, impacting on signalling and cellular phenotypes in prostate cancer.
26035357|a|UNASSIGNED: Monocarboxylate Transporter 2 (MCT2) is a major pyruvate transporter encoded by the SLC16A7 gene. Recent studies pointed to a consistent overexpression of MCT2 in prostate cancer (PCa) suggesting MCT2 as a putative biomarker and molecular target. Despite the importance of this observation the mechanisms involved in MCT2 regulation are unknown. Through an integrative analysis we have discovered that selective demethylation of an internal SLC16A7/MCT2 promoter is a recurrent event in independent PCa cohorts. This demethylation is associated with expression of isoforms differing only in 5'-UTR translational control motifs, providing one contributing mechanism for MCT2 protein overexpression in PCa. Genes co-expressed with SLC16A7/MCT2 also clustered in oncogenic-related pathways and effectors of these signalling pathways were found to bind at the SLC16A7/MCT2 gene locus. Finally, MCT2 knock-down attenuated the growth of PCa cells. The present study unveils an unexpected epigenetic regulation of SLC16A7/MCT2 isoforms and identifies a link between SLC16A7/MCT2, Androgen Receptor (AR), ETS-related gene (ERG) and other oncogenic pathways in PCa. These results underscore the importance of combining data from epigenetic, transcriptomic and protein level changes to allow more comprehensive insights into the mechanisms underlying protein expression, that in our case provide additional weight to MCT2 as a candidate biomarker and molecular target in PCa.

26031034|t|[Prevalence and routes of transmission of pyloric Helicobacter infection. II. Transmission infection from an external source (literature review)].
26031034|a|AIM OF THE STUDY: On the available reports to assess the possibility of the infection with pyloric Helicobacter (H.pylori) from external sources--via contaminated food and water. BASIC CONCEPTS: H. pylori was established to be unable to multiply in dairy and other products, but under favorable conditions, can survive in the limited time. There are obtained epidemiological data about the feedback between the prevalence of H. pylori infection in the region and the availability of safe water. There was recorded ability of bacteria to survive for a short time in water in bacillary virulent form. In different water sources in different countries there was found H. pylori coccal form. CONCLUSION: H. pylori ability to survive in the commonly used product supports the hypothesis that contaminated food (tank-human) may serve as a conductor of infection. The literature data testify to the possibility and importance of the waterway for H. pylori infection transmission that changes the approaches to prophylaxis and the prevention of associated with it diseases.

26032102|t|Skeletal muscle proteins: a new approach to delimitate the time since death.
26032102|a|PURPOSE: Skeletal muscle tissue is proposed as a forensic model tissue with strong potential, as it is easily accessible and its true-to-life state structure and function is well known. Despite this strong potential, skeletal muscle degradation studies are rare. The aim of this study was to test if a skeletal muscle-based protein analysis is applicable to delimitate the time since death. METHODS: Under standard conditions, two pigs were stored either at 22    C for 5  days or 4    C for 21  days. Their Mm. biceps femori were sampled periodically for analyses of ten skeletal muscle proteins postmortem. RESULTS: All analyzed proteins can serve as markers for a delimitation of the time since death. Desmin, nebulin, titin, and SERCA 1 displayed distinct protein patterns at certain points of time. The other five proteins, a-actinin, calsequestrin-1, laminin, troponin T-C, and SERCA 2, showed no degradation patterns within the analyzed postmortem time frame. CONCLUSIONS: Referring to specific skeletal muscle proteins, results showed short-term stabilities for just a minority of analyzed proteins, while the majority of investigated proteins displayed characteristics as long-term markers. Due to specific patterns and the possibility to determine definite constraints of the presence, absence, or pattern alterations of single proteins, the feasibility of porcine skeletal muscle as forensic model tissue is outlined and the potential of skeletal muscle as forensic model tissue is underlined, especially with respect to later postmortem phases, which so far lack feasible methods to delimitate the time since death.

26005718|t|A Novel Network Model for Molecular Prognosis.
26005718|a|UNASSIGNED: Network-based genome-wide association studies (NWAS) utilize the molecular interactions between genes and functional pathways in biomarker identification. This study presents a novel network-based methodology for identifying prognostic gene signatures to predict cancer recurrence. The methodology contains the following steps: 1) Constructing genome-wide coexpression networks for different disease states (metastatic vs. non-metastatic). Prediction logic is used to induct valid implication relations between each pair of gene expression profiles in terms of formal logic rules. 2) Identifying differential components associated with specific disease states from the genome-wide coexpression networks. 3) Dissecting network modules that are tightly connected with major disease signal hallmarks from the disease specific differential components. 4) Identifying most significant genes/probes associated with clinical outcome from the pathway connected network modules. Using this methodology, a 14-gene prognostic signature was identified for accurate patient stratification in early stage lung cancer.

26005222|t|Ambient Air Temperature Does Not Predict whether Small or Large Workers Forage in Bumble Bees (Bombus impatiens).
26005222|a|UNASSIGNED: Bumble bees are important pollinators of crops and other plants. However, many aspects of their basic biology remain relatively unexplored. For example, one important and unusual natural history feature in bumble bees is the massive size variation seen between workers of the same nest. This size polymorphism may be an adaptation for division of labor, colony economics, or be nonadaptive. It was also suggested that perhaps this variation allows for niche specialization in workers foraging at different temperatures: larger bees might be better suited to forage at cooler temperatures and smaller bees might be better suited to forage at warmer temperatures. This we tested here using a large, enclosed growth chamber, where we were able to regulate the ambient temperature. We found no significant effect of ambient or nest temperature on the average size of bees flying to and foraging from a suspended feeder. Instead, bees of all sizes successfully flew and foraged between 16  C and 36  C. Thus, large bees foraged even at very hot temperatures, which we thought might cause overheating. Size variation therefore could not be explained in terms of niche specialization for foragers at different temperatures.

26041515|t|When is an acoustic neuroma not an acoustic neuroma? Pitfalls for radiosurgeons.
26041515|a|INTRODUCTION: Because acoustic neuroma (AN), also termed vestibular schwannoma, constitutes by far the commonest intracranial schwannoma and cerebello-pontine angle (CPA) tumour, there is a risk of overlooking rarer alternative diagnoses with similar clinical and/or radiological features. The purpose of this article is to highlight to radiosurgeons the potentially serious implications of this problem through illustrative case studies. METHODS: Our linac stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) technique has been previously described, with stereotactic headring fixation and treatment delivered via cones or micro-multileaf collimators using multiple arcs or static beams. RESULTS: Between November 1993 and October 2014, we treated 132 patients referred with a clinical diagnosis of AN, the vast majority with 12   Gy marginal dose. Three of these (2.3%), evident either at the time of treatment (2) or subsequently (1), had features instead consistent with cochlear schwannoma, facial schwannoma and meningioma, respectively. Each warranted significant modification to standard AN outlining and fields. The meningioma progressed due to geographic miss. One other patient with recurrent facial schwannoma (not yet needing SRS) was also referred with an incorrect diagnosis of AN. CONCLUSION: When rare variants of common medical problems are not identified before referral, there is a risk that 'blinkering' can lead to misdiagnosis and suboptimal treatment. Radiosurgeons need to be particularly mindful of this issue with AN, which can mimic several other tumours occurring in the CPA region, albeit with different patterns of spread. Optimal imaging, high-quality radiology reporting and neuroradiology input at the time of SRS planning within the setting of a specialised multidisciplinary team are highly desirable.

26031385|t|An overview of recent developments in the analytical detection of new psychoactive substances (NPSs).
26031385|a|UNASSIGNED: New psychoactive substances (NPSs), sometimes referred to as "legal highs" in more colloquial environments/the media, are a class of compounds that have been recently made available for abuse (not necessarily recently discovered) which provide similar effects to the traditional well studied illegal drugs but are not always controlled under existing local, regional or international drug legislation. Following an unprecedented increase in the number of NPSs in the last 5 years (with 101 substances discovered for the first time in 2014 alone) its, occasionally fatal, consequences have been extensively reported in the media. Such NPSs are typically marketed as 'not for human consumption' and are instead labelled and sold as plant food, bath salts as well as a whole host of other equally nondescript aliases in order to bypass legislative controls. NPSs are a new multi-disciplinary research field with the main emphasis in terms of forensic identification due to their adverse health effects, which can range from minimal to life threatening and even fatalities. In this mini-review we overview this recent emerging research area of NPSs and the analytical approaches reported to provide detection strategies as well as detailing recent reports towards providing point-of-care/in-the-field NPS ("legal high") sensors.

26047431|t|Effects of -1.5  C Super-chilling on quality of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) pre-rigor Fillets: Cathepsin activity, muscle histology, texture and liquid leakage.
26047431|a|UNASSIGNED: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of super-chilling on the quality of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) pre-rigor fillets. The fillets were kept for 45min in a super-chilling tunnel at -25  C with an air speed in the tunnel at 2.5m/s, to reach a fillet core temperature of -1.5  C, prior to ice storage in a cold room for 4 weeks. Super-chilling seemed to form intra- and extracellular ice crystals in the upper layer of the fillets and prevent myofibre contraction. Lysosome breakages followed by release of cathepsin B and L during storage and myofibre-myofibre detachments were accelerated in the super-chilled fillets. Super-chilling resulted in higher liquid leakage and increased myofibre breakages in the fillets, while texture values of fillets measured instrumentally were not affected by super-chilling one week after treatment. Optimisation of the super-chilling technique is needed to avoid the formation of ice crystals, which may cause irreversible destruction of the myofibres, in order to obtain high quality products.

26061519|a|UNASSIGNED: In the past decade rickets has re-emerged in developed countries due to changes in lifestyles and dietary habits. We describe a case of a 28-month-old black infant with failure to thrive. He was exclusively breastfed until nine months of age, without vitamin supplementation, and never ingested milk products due to alleged cow      s milk intolerance. His examination revealed bowlegs, rachitic rosary and wide wrists. Alkaline phosphatase and intact parathyroid hormone levels were elevated, and calcidiol was decreased. Radiographic images showed bone demineralization, fraying and cupping of the distal radius and ulna. Nutritional rickets was considered and treatment with colecalciferol and calcium carbonate was initiated, with clinical, laboratory and radiologic improvement. In this case, a group of factors contributed to severe nutritional rickets, alerting to the re-emergence of this disease.

26061292|t|LDL Receptor-Related Protein-1 (LRP1) Regulates Cholesterol Accumulation in Macrophages.
26061292|a|UNASSIGNED: Within the circulation, cholesterol is transported by lipoprotein particles and is taken up by cells when these particles associate with cellular receptors. In macrophages, excessive lipoprotein particle uptake leads to foam cell formation, which is an early event in the development of atherosclerosis. Currently, mechanisms responsible for foam cell formation are incompletely understood. To date, several macrophage receptors have been identified that contribute to the uptake of modified forms of lipoproteins leading to foam cell formation, but the contribution of the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) to this process is not known. To investigate the role of LRP1 in cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, we generated mice with a selective deletion of LRP1 in macrophages on an LDL receptor (LDLR)-deficient background (macLRP1-/-). After feeding mice a high fat diet for 11 weeks, peritoneal macrophages isolated from Lrp+/+ mice contained significantly higher levels of total cholesterol than those from macLRP1-/- mice. Further analysis revealed that this was due to increased levels of cholesterol esters. Interestingly, macLRP1-/- mice displayed elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels resulting from accumulation of large, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles in the circulation. This increase did not result from an increase in hepatic VLDL biosynthesis, but rather results from a defect in catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles in macLRP1-/- mice. These studies reveal an important in vivo contribution of macrophage LRP1 to cholesterol homeostasis.

26059748|t|The effects of aerobic endurance exercise on pulse wave velocity and intima media thickness in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
26059748|a|UNASSIGNED: The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or cohort studies that evaluated the effect of aerobic endurance exercise on pulse wave velocity (PWV) and intima media thickness (IMT) in adults. IMT and PWV were the most commonly used parameters for the assessment of arterial stiffness. The MEDLINE, Cochrane, ISI, and Ovid databases were searched between January 2000 and February 2015. A total of 1654 participants in 26 RCTs and two cohort studies were included in the meta-analysis. In studies for which PWV was the outcome, aerobic endurance exercise had a significant effect on reducing PWV [-0.67, 95% CI -0.97, -0.38; I(2) =   89%; heterogeneity, P   <   0.0001]. Changes in peripheral arterial PWV were statistically greater than in central arterial PWV. In the RCTs for which IMT was the outcome, changes [-0.04, 95% CI -0.12, 0.04; I(2)    =   95%; heterogeneity, P   <   0.00001] in IMT did not reach statistical significance. In the two cohort studies, changes [-8.81, 95% CI -9.25, -8.37; I(2)    =   22%; heterogeneity, P   =   0.26] in IMT were statistically significant. Subgroup analysis indicated a longer duration aerobic exercise and a greater improvement in VO2max were associated with larger reductions in PWV. Reductions in IMT were observed in two cohort studies, but not in four RCTs.

26062022|t|Re-Examining of Moffitt's Theory of Delinquency through Agent Based Modeling.
26062022|a|UNASSIGNED: Moffitt's theory of delinquency suggests that at-risk youths can be divided into two groups, the adolescence- limited group and the life-course-persistent group, predetermined at a young age, and social interactions between these two groups become important during the adolescent years. We built an agent-based model based on the microscopic interactions Moffitt described: (i) a maturity gap that dictates (ii) the cost and reward of antisocial behavior, and (iii) agents imitating the antisocial behaviors of others more successful than themselves, to find indeed the two groups emerging in our simulations. Moreover, through an intervention simulation where we moved selected agents from one social network to another, we also found that the social network plays an important role in shaping the life course outcome.

26061037|t|International Differences in Treatment and Clinical Outcomes for High Grade Glioma.
26061037|a|BACKGROUND: High grade gliomas are the most common type of malignant brain tumor, and despite their rarity, cause significant morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to compare the treatment patterns of high grade glioma to examine survival patterns in patients who receive specific treatments between cohorts in Ohio and Taiwan. METHOD: Patients aged 18 years and older at age of diagnosis with World Health Organization (WHO) grade III or IV astrocytoma from 2007-2012 were selected from the Ohio Brain Tumor Study and the Taiwan Cancer Registry. The treatment information was derived from medical chart reviews in Ohio and National Health Insurance Research Data in Taiwan. Treatment examined included surgical procedure (brain biopsy and/or resection), radiotherapy (radiation and/or radiosurgery), and alkylating chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier and parametric survival models were used to examine the effect of treatment on survival, adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities. RESULTS: 294 patients in Ohio and 1,097 patients in Taiwan met the inclusion criteria. 70.3% patients in Ohio and 51.4% in Taiwan received surgical resection, followed by concurrent chemoradiation. Patients who received this treatment had the highest survival rate, with a 1-year survival rate of 72.8% in Ohio and 73.4% in Taiwan. Patients who did not receive surgical resection, followed by concurrent chemoradiation had an increased risk of death (hazard ratio of 5.03 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.61-7.02] in Ohio and 1.49 [95% CI: 1.31-1.71] in Taiwan) after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Surgical resection followed by concurrent chemoradiation was associated with higher survival rate of patients with high grade glioma in both Ohio and Taiwan; however, one-third of patients in Ohio and half in Taiwan did not receive this treatment.

26059842|t|The use of whole-exome sequencing to disentangle complex phenotypes.
26059842|a|UNASSIGNED: The success of whole-exome sequencing to identify mutations causing single-gene disorders has been well documented. In contrast whole-exome sequencing has so far had limited success in the identification of variants causing more complex phenotypes that seem unlikely to be due to the disruption of a single gene. We describe a family where two male offspring of healthy first cousin parents present a complex phenotype consisting of peripheral neuropathy and bronchiectasis that has not been described previously in the literature. Due to the fact that both children had the same problems in the context of parental consanguinity we hypothesised illness resulted from either X-linked or autosomal recessive inheritance. Through the use of whole-exome sequencing we were able to simplify this complex phenotype and identified a causative mutation (p.R1070*) in the gene periaxin (PRX), a gene previously shown to cause peripheral neuropathy (Dejerine-Sottas syndrome) when this mutation is present. For the bronchiectasis phenotype we were unable to identify a causal single mutation or compound heterozygote, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of this phenotype. In conclusion, in this study we show that whole-exome sequencing has the power to disentangle complex phenotypes through the identification of causative genetic mutations for distinct clinical disorders that were previously masked.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 10 June 2015; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2015.121.

26011478|t|Development of a Brief Version of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory.
26011478|a|UNASSIGNED: With theoretical and empirical interest in narcissism growing, there is a need for brief measures of pathological narcissism that can be used more practically while assessing the construct comprehensively. Data from four samples (total N = 3,851) collected across two separate research groups and representing undergraduate, community, and clinical populations were used to establish the reliability, validity, and utility of the Brief-Pathological Narcissism Inventory (B-PNI). Item response theory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to determine the best-performing 28 items from the original PNI and ensure that the B-PNI exhibited a factor structure consistent with the original PNI. Items were retained for all seven pathological narcissism facet scales. Additional results also support the criterion validity of the B-PNI, suggesting that it can be used in place of the original PNI to assess the various facets of pathological narcissism effectively and without loss of information, which may enhance the ability of researchers to investigate pathological narcissism in future work.

Results showed that the first pandemic was frequently framed with the medical/scientific and political/legal issues, while the second pandemic was emphasized with the health risk issue in TV news. Both flu pandemics were regularly reported with mortality exemplars, but the focus in the first pandemic was on the flu virus threat and vaccination side effects, while the vaccination shortage was frequently revealed in the second outbreak.

26073878|t|3 Tesla MRI detects deterioration in proximal femur microarchitecture and strength in long-term glucocorticoid users compared with controls.
26073878|a|BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) is the most common secondary form of osteoporosis, and glucocorticoid users are at increased risk for fracture compared with nonusers. There is no established relationship between bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk in GIO. We used 3 Tesla (T) MRI to investigate how proximal femur microarchitecture is altered in subjects with GIO. METHODS: This study had institutional review board approval. We recruited 6 subjects with long-term (> 1 year) glucocorticoid use (median age   =   52.5 (39.2-58.7) years) and 6 controls (median age   =   65.5 [62-75.5] years). For the nondominant hip, all subjects underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess BMD and 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, 3D FLASH) to assess metrics of bone microarchitecture and strength. RESULTS: Compared with controls, glucocorticoid users demonstrated lower femoral neck trabecular number (-50.3%, 1.12 [0.84-1.54] mm(-1) versus 2.27 [1.88-2.73] mm(-1) , P   =   0.02), plate-to-rod ratio (-20.1%, 1.48 [1.39-1.71] versus 1.86 [1.76-2.20], P   =   0.03), and elastic modulus (-64.8% to -74.8%, 1.54 [1.22-3.19] GPa to 2.31 [1.87-4.44] GPa versus 6.15 [5.00-7.09] GPa to 6.59 [5.58-7.31] GPa, P   <   0.05), and higher femoral neck trabecular separation (+192%, 0.705 [0.462-1.00] mm versus 0.241 [0.194-0.327] mm, P   =   0.02). There were no differences in femoral neck trabecular thickness (-2.7%, 0.193 [0.184-0.217] mm versus 0.199 [0.179-0.210] mm, P   =   0.94) or femoral neck BMD T-scores (+20.7%, -2.1 [-2.8 to -1.4] versus -2.6 [-3.3 to -2.5], P   =   0.24) between groups. CONCLUSION: The 3T MRI can potentially detect detrimental changes in proximal femur microarchitecture and strength in long-term glucocorticoid users.J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015.

26066318|t|AllelicImbalance: an R/ bioconductor package for detecting, managing, and visualizing allele expression imbalance data from RNA sequencing.
26066318|a|BACKGROUND: One aspect in which RNA sequencing is more valuable than microarray-based methods is the ability to examine the allelic imbalance of the expression of a gene. This process is often a complex task that entails quality control, alignment, and the counting of reads over heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Allelic imbalance analysis is subject to technical biases, due to differences in the sequences of the measured alleles. Flexible bioinformatics tools are needed to ease the workflow while retaining as much RNA sequencing information as possible throughout the analysis to detect and address the possible biases. RESULTS: We present AllelicImblance, a software program that is designed to detect, manage, and visualize allelic imbalances comprehensively. The purpose of this software is to allow users to pose genetic questions in any RNA sequencing experiment quickly, enhancing the general utility of RNA sequencing. The visualization features can reveal notable, non-trivial allelic imbalance behavior over specific regions, such as exons. CONCLUSIONS: The software provides a complete framework to perform allelic imbalance analyses of aligned RNA sequencing data, from detection to visualization, within the robust and versatile management class, ASEset.

26077098|t|Neural innervation patterns in the sacral vertebral body.
26077098|a|PURPOSE: To characterize the distribution of nerves within a single S1 vertebral body, with particular emphasis on the superior endplate that interfaces with the L5/S1 disc. METHODS: Musculature and connective tissue surrounding the sacrum was carefully dissected away for close visual inspection of penetrating nerve fibers. The S1 vertebral body was then isolated for histology and serial coronal sections were cut and stained with a ubiquitous neural antibody marker (PGP 9.5). Slides were analyzed and nerves were manually marked on high resolution, composite captured images, rendering 3D depictions of internal nerve distribution. RESULTS: The vast majority of nerves were closely associated with blood vessels within the marrow space with a uniform distribution in both the superior and inferior endplates of the S1 vertebral body. The highest nerve density was seen at the centrum (anatomic center) of the S1 vertebral body with smaller peaks seen at the lateral borders. Nerve fibers were observed branching from anterior sacral nerves and penetrating the lateral border of the S1 (during dissection), corresponding with peaks on nerve density maps. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the S1 body and endplate are densely innervated and the peak in nerve density at the vertebral center coincides with vasculature patterns previously described in lumbar vertebral bodies. In the sacrum, however, there is no posterior nutrient foramen that facilitates nerve penetration through the vertebral cortex. Rather, our data indicate that nerves penetrate the S1 via the lateral aspects, consistent with being branches of the anterior sacral nerve. Since PGP 9.5 is a ubiquitous neural marker these identified nerves are likely composed of a mixed population of nociceptive and autonomic fibers.

26010459|t|Chronic pain in the pelvic area or lower extremities after rectal cancer treatment and its impact on quality of life. A population-based, cross-sectional study.
26010459|a|UNASSIGNED: Aim of this investigation was to examine the prevalence of and factors associated with chronic pain in the pelvic area or lower extremities after rectal cancer treatment and its impact on quality of life.This is a population-based, cross-sectional study of chronic pain and quality of life in patients treated for rectal cancer from 2001 to 2007. A modified version of the brief, descriptive Danish pain questionnaire and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 questionnaire were mailed to 1713 Danish patients.Informative answers were obtained from 1369 patients (80 %). A total of 426 patients (31 %) reported chronic pain in the pelvic area or lower extremities, 173 (41 %) of whom had daily pain. Pain in other parts of the body was associated with the presence of pain in the pelvic region (OR 4.81 [3.63; 6.38],p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed an association with chronic pain in female patients (OR 1.91 [1.51; 2.43],p<0.001) and in those who received radio(chemo)therapy (OR 1.31[1.01:1.7],p=0.041) or underwent abdominoperineal excision (OR: 1.71 [1.19; 2.44],p=0.003), total mesorectal excision (1.39[1.01;1.90],p=0.041], and Hartmann s procedure (OR 1.72 [1.04;2.84],p=0.33) compared to partial mesorectal excision. Ordinal regression analysis showed a strong association between all quality of life subgroups and pelvic pain.Chronic pain in the pelvic region or lower extremities after rectal cancer treatment is a common but largely neglected problem that is associated with female gender, type of surgery, radio(chemo)therapy and young age, all of which impact the patient's quality of life.

26073165|t|Fungal specificity and selectivity for algae play a major role in determining lichen partnerships across diverse ecogeographic regions in the lichen-forming family Parmeliaceae (Ascomycota).
26073165|a|UNASSIGNED: Microbial symbionts are instrumental to the ecological and long-term evolutionary success of their hosts, and the central role of symbiotic interactions is increasingly recognized across the vast majority of life. Lichens provide an iconic group for investigating patterns in species interactions; however, relationships among lichen symbionts are often masked by uncertain species boundaries or inability to reliably identify symbionts. The species-rich lichen-forming fungal family Parmeliaceae provides a diverse group for assessing patterns of interactions of algal symbionts, and our study addresses patterns of lichen symbiont interactions at the largest geographic and taxonomic scales attempted to date. We analyzed a total of 2356 algal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequences collected from lichens representing ten mycobiont genera in Parmeliaceae, two genera in Lecanoraceae, and 26 cultured Trebouxia strains. Algal ITS sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs); and we attempted to validate the evolutionary independence of a subset of the inferred OTUs using chloroplast and mitochondrial loci. We explored patterns of symbiont interactions in these lichens based on ecogeographic distributions and mycobiont taxonomy. We found high levels of undescribed diversity in Trebouxia, broad distributions across distinct ecoregions for many photobiont OTUs, and varying levels of mycobiont selectivity and specificity towards the photobiont. Based on these results, we conclude that fungal specificity and selectivity for algal partners play a major role in determining lichen partnerships, potentially superseding ecology, at least at the ecogeographical scale investigated here. In order to facilitate effective communication and consistency across future studies, we propose a provisional naming system for Trebouxia photobionts and provide representative sequences for each OTU circumscribed in this study.

26051248|t|A Fluorogenic Aryl Fluorosulfate for Intraorganellar Transthyretin Imaging in Living Cells and in Caenorhabditis elegans.
26051248|a|UNASSIGNED: Fluorogenic probes, due to their often greater spatial and temporal sensitivity in comparison to permanently fluorescent small molecules, represent powerful tools to study protein localization and function in the context of living systems. Herein, we report fluorogenic probe 4, a 1,3,4-oxadiazole designed to bind selectively to transthyretin (TTR). Probe 4 comprises a fluorosulfate group not previously used in an environment-sensitive fluorophore. The fluorosulfate functional group does not react covalently with TTR on the time scale required for cellular imaging, but does red shift the emission maximum of probe 4 in comparison to its nonfluorosulfated analogue. We demonstrate that probe 4 is dark in aqueous buffers, whereas the TTR  4 complex exhibits a fluorescence emission maximum at 481 nm. The addition of probe 4 to living HEK293T cells allows efficient binding to and imaging of exogenous TTR within intracellular organelles, including the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, live Caenorhabditis elegans expressing human TTR transgenically and treated with probe 4 display TTR  4 fluorescence in macrophage-like coelomocytes. An analogue of fluorosulfate probe 4 does react selectively with TTR without labeling the remainder of the cellular proteome. Studies on this analogue suggest that certain aryl fluorosulfates, due to their cell and organelle permeability and activatable reactivity, could be considered for the development of protein-selective covalent probes.

26072824|t|Software-defined reconfigurable microwave photonics processor.
26072824|a|We propose, for the first time to our knowledge, a software-defined reconfigurable microwave photonics signal processor architecture that can be integrated on a chip and is capable of performing all the main functionalities by suitable programming of its control signals. The basic configuration is presented and a thorough end-to-end design model derived that accounts for the performance of the overall processor taking into consideration the impact and interdependencies of both its photonic and RF parts.

26105708|t|Incidence and predictors of non-fatal drug overdose after release from prison among people who inject drugs in Queensland, Australia.
26105708|a|INTRODUCTION: Release from prison is a period of elevated risk for drug-related harms, particularly among people who inject drugs (PWID). Non-fatal overdose can cause serious morbidity and predicts future fatal overdose, however neither the incidence nor the risk factors for non-fatal overdose following release from prison are well understood. METHODS: Structured health-related interviews were conducted with 1051 adult prisoners in Queensland, Australia prior to release and approximately 1, 3 and 6 months post-release. Incidence of self-reported overdose in the community was calculated for PWID and all prisoners for three discrete time periods. Negative binomial regression with robust error variance was used to identify pre-release predictors of overdose among PWID. RESULTS: The incidence of reported overdose was highest between 1 and 3 months post-release (37.8 per 100 person-years (PY) among PWID; 24.5/100 PY among all ex-prisoners). In adjusted analyses, the risk of post-release non-fatal overdose was higher for PWID who reported: being unemployed for >6 months before prison, having been removed from family as a child, at least weekly use of benzodiazepines and/or pharmaceutical opiates in the 3 months prior to prison, and ever receiving opioid substitution therapy (OST). Pre-release psychological distress and a lifetime history of mental disorder also predicted overdose, whereas risky alcohol use in the year before prison was protective. CONCLUSIONS: PWID have a high risk of overdose following release from prison. Imprisonment is an opportunity to initiate targeted preventive interventions such as OST, overdose prevention training and peer-delivered naloxone for those with a high risk profile.

26106148|t|SWP73 Subunits of Arabidopsis SWI/SNF Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Play Distinct Roles in Leaf and Flower Development.
26106148|a|UNASSIGNED: Arabidopsis thaliana SWP73A and SWP73B are homologs of mammalian BRAHMA-associated factors (BAF60s) that tether SWITCH/SUCROSE NONFERMENTING chromatin remodeling complexes to transcription factors of genes regulating various cell differentiation pathways. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana SWP73s modulate several important developmental pathways. While undergoing normal vegetative development, swp73a mutants display reduced expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C and early flowering in short days. By contrast, swp73b mutants are characterized by retarded growth, severe defects in leaf and flower development, delayed flowering, and male sterility. MNase-Seq, transcript profiling, and ChIP-Seq studies demonstrate that SWP73B binds the promoters of ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 and 2, KANADI1 and 3, and YABBY2, 3, and 5 genes, which regulate leaf development and show coordinately altered transcription in swp73b plants. Lack of SWP73B alters the expression patterns of APETALA1, APETALA3, and the MADS box gene AGL24, whereas other floral organ identity genes show reduced expression correlating with defects in flower development. Consistently, SWP73B binds to the promoter regions of APETALA1 and 3, SEPALLATA3, LEAFY, UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, TERMINAL FLOWER1, AGAMOUS-LIKE24, and SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS OVEREXPRESSION1 genes, and the swp73b mutation alters nucleosome occupancy on most of these loci. In conclusion, SWP73B acts as important modulator of major developmental pathways, while SWP73A functions in flowering time control.

26031603|t|Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine and neuroendocrine-like features. Morphologic, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and array comparative genomic hybridization analysis of 18 cases and review of the literature.
26031603|a|UNASSIGNED: Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (CRCC) with neuroendocrine differentiation (CRCCND) has only recently been described. Eighteen cases of CRCC with morphologic features suggestive of neuroendocrine differentiation were selected from among 624 CRCCs in our registry. The tissues were fixed in neutral formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut into 4- to 5- m-thick sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. As CRCC with neuroendocrine features, tumors with following morphology were suggested: (1) trabecular/palisading/ribbon-like, gyriform, insular, glandular, and solid pattern; (2) uniform polygonal cells formed in small islets; and (3) cribriform pattern in combination with palisading. Selected cases were further analyzed using immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, array comparative genomic hybridization, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Cases were classified as CRCCND or CRCC with neuroendocrine-like features (CRCCND-L) based on the immunohistochemical expression of neuroendocrine markers: CRCCND, 4 cases, age range 49 to 79 years, size ranged from 2.2 to 22 cm, and CRCCND-L, 14 cases, age range 34 to 74 years, size range 3.8 to 16.5 cm. Follow-up information was available for 11 of 18 patients aged 0.5 to 12 years. Two of 4 CRCCNDs showed aggressive clinical course with metastatic spreading. Chromophobe renal cell carcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation were focally positive for CD56 (4/4), synaptophysin (4/4), chromogranin A (1/4), and neuron-specific enolase (3/4). All 14 CRCCND-Ls were mostly negative or very weakly focally positive for some of the aforementioned markers. All 18 tumors were positive for cytokeratin 7 and CD117. Ultrastructural analysis showed poorly preserved neuroendocrine granules only in 2 of 4 analyzed CRCCNDs. Losses of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, and 10 were found in all analyzable CRCCNDs, whereas multiple losses (chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 10, 13, 17, and 21) and gains (chromosomes 4, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, and 20) were found in CRCCND-L.

26016026|t|[Effects of silver nitrate on the phase state of model multibilayer membranes].
26016026|a|In order to study the effects caused by silver nitrate (AgNO3) on model lipid membranes, we studied multibilayer membranes based on L-a-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and AgNO3 aqueous soluitions in a wide concentration range (up to 30 wt%) by means of differential scanning calorimetry. It has been shown that the presence of AgNO3 leads both to an increase in the main phase transition temperature (T(m)) and appearance of an additional phase transition peak (T(m)), suggesting increasing of both density and heterogeneity of the lipid membrane. The effect of nitrate ions (NO ) was shown to be of the opposite nature (bilayer fluidizing), so the integral densifying effect of AgNO3 can be referred solely to the action of silver ions (Ag(+)). With increasing AgNO3 concentration, the tendency was observed to opposite changes in T(m) and T'(m) peaks intensity, thereby at about 26. wt% of AgNO3 the initial peak (T(m)) disappeared. In the range of Ag+ therapeutic concentrations (up to 2 wt%) no significant changes in the DPPC membrane were revealed. This can be one of the reasons of the absence of a damaging effect of silver drugs on a host organism with simultaneous pronounced bactericidal effect.

26017185|t|Cigarette smokers develop structurally modified hemoglobin: a possible way of increasing oxidative stress.
26017185|a|CONTEXT: Increased levels of free radicals and various reactive species along with reduced antioxidant defence system are the major threat to erythrocyte in tobacco smokers. Thus, the hemoglobin (Hb) within the erythrocyte is very prone to oxidative damage. Earlier reports suggest that cigarette smoking is related with the glutathionylation and formation of adducts of Hb. OBJECTIVE: We have highlighted the possible changes in secondary and tertiary structures of Hb in cigarette smokers and its physiological consequences. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Twenty smokers and 18 non-smokers, aged 25-35 years were volunteered in this study. We used flow cytometry for measuring intracellular reactive oxygen species (IcROS). The purified Hb was subjected to different spectrophotometric, fluoremetric and circular dichroic (CD) analysis. The hydrophobicity, thermal stability, heme release and oxidation of purified Hb were also studied. RESULT: We observed that the IcROS was also higher in cigarette smokers than non-smokers. The data of intrinsic fluorescence, synchronous fluorescence and tryptophan quenching studies showed that the microenvironments of b37 tryptophan and tyrosine residues of Hb were moved toward more hydrophobic region in cigarette smokers. Increased hydrophobicity and thermal stability furthermore indicated more compactness of smokers' hemoglobin. From CD spectra, we confirmed an overall modification of the secondary and tertiary structures of hemoglobin in smokers. Both auto- and co-oxidation rates of purified Hb were found to be higher in cigarette smokers. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We conclude that the modified Hb in cigarette smokers may further enhance the oxidative insult within the cell.

26016476|t|Compounds identified by virtual docking to a tetrameric EGFR extracellular domain can modulate Grb2 internalization.
26016476|a|BACKGROUND: Overexpression or mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) potently enhances the growth of many solid tumors. Tumor cells frequently display resistance to mechanistically-distinct EGFR-directed therapeutic agents, making it valuable to develop therapeutics that work by additional mechanisms. Current EGFR-targeting therapeutics include antibodies targeting the extracellular domains, and small molecules inhibiting the intracellular kinase domain. Recent studies have identified a novel prone extracellular tetrameric EGFR configuration, which we identify as a potential target for drug discovery. METHODS: Our focus is on the prone EGFR tetramer, which contains a novel protein-protein interface involving extracellular domain III. This EGFR tetramer is computationally targeted for stabilization by small molecule ligand binding. This study performed virtual screening of a Life Chemicals, Inc. small molecule library of 345,232 drug-like compounds against a molecular dynamics simulation of protein-protein interfaces distinct to the novel tetramer. One hundred nine chemically diverse candidate molecules were selected and evaluated using a cell-based high-content imaging screen that directly assessed induced internalization of the EGFR effector protein Grb2. Positive hits were further evaluated for influence on phosphorylation of EGFR and its effector ERK1/2. RESULTS: Fourteen hit compounds affected internalization of Grb2, an adaptor responsive to EGFR activation. Most hits had limited effect on cell viability, and minimally influenced EGFR and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Docked hit compound poses generally include Arg270 or neighboring residues, which are also involved in binding the effective therapeutic cetuximab, guiding further chemical optimization. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the EGFR tetrameric configuration offers a novel cancer drug target.

26011475|t|The Receptor for the CD200 Tolerance-Signaling Molecule Associated with Successful Pregnancy is Expressed by Early-Stage Breast Cancer Cells in 80% of Patients and by Term Placental Trophoblasts.
26011475|a|PROBLEM: The CD200 tolerance-signaling molecule that is expressed by a wide variety of tissues, including placental trophoblast and epithelial tumor cells, lacks an intracytoplasmic tail and must act by binding to CD200 receptors that have a limited expression on lymphomyeloid cells. This binding can inhibit inflammation and NK cells, promote macrophage secretion of indoleamine-2,3 dioxygenase (IDO), and promote generation of Treg cells. Recently, CD200R1 was reported on human first trimester placental villous trophoblast cells. CD200R1 has not been described on malignant tumor cells. As malignant tumor cells exhibit a number of characteristics of trophoblast, is CD200R1 expressed? METHOD OF STUDY: Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to CD200 and CD200R1 were used to immunostain tissue blocks available from cases in a previous cross-sectional study of Stage 1-IIIA human breast cancer cases and term placental trophoblast. RESULTS: Affinity-purified anti-CD200R1 stained primary breast cancer cells and term placental villous trophoblasts. Tumor cells were also stained by anti-CD200 as in a previous study (correlation P  =  0.0042), but CD200R1 and CD200 were not correlated. Presence or absence of strong CD200 expression in the tumor did not correlate with metastasis, and a similar result was obtained with CD200R1. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of CD200R1 expression by human epithelial tumor cells, and specifically, early-stage human breast cancer cells. It is also the first report of CD200R1 expression by term placental villous trophoblasts. The potential biological significance of CD200R1 expression in non-hematopoietic cells is discussed.

26106492|t|A Case of Fulminant Hepatitis due to Echovirus 9 in a Patient on Maintenance Rituximab Therapy for Follicular Lymphoma.
26106492|a|Rituximab is a CD20 monoclonal antibody commonly used in the treatment of haematological malignancies. It causes lymphopenia with subsequent compromised humoral immunity resulting in an increased risk of infection. A number of infections and viral reactivations have been described as complicating Rituximab therapy. We report an apparently unique case of echovirus 9 (an enterovirus) infection causing an acute hepatitis and significant morbidity in an adult patient on maintenance treatment of Rituximab for follicular lymphoma. We also describe potential missed opportunities to employ more robust screening for viral infections which may have prevented delays in the appropriate treatment and thus may have altered the patient's clinical course. We also make suggestions for lowering the threshold of viral testing in similar patients in the future.

26073991|t|Exploring the comparative binding aspects of benzophenanthridine plant alkaloid chelerythrine with RNA triple and double helices: a spectroscopic and calorimetric approach.
26073991|a|UNASSIGNED: A comparative study on the interaction of a benzophenanthridine alkaloid chelerythrine (CHL) with RNA triplex poly(U).poly(A)*poly(U) (hereafter U.A*U, .(dot) and *(asterisk) represent Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen base pairing respectively) and its parent duplex poly(A).poly(U) (A.U) was carried out by using a combination of various spectroscopic, viscometric and calorimetric techniques. The interaction was characterized by hypochromic and bathochromic effects in the absorption spectrum, the increase of thermal melting temperature, enhancement in solution viscosity, and perturbation in the circular dichroic spectrum. The binding constant calculated by using spectrophotometric data was in the order of 10(5) for both forms of RNA, but it was greater for triplex RNA (30.2 * 10(5) M(-1)) than duplex RNA (3.6 * 10(5) M(-1)). Isothermal titration calorimetric data are in good agreement with the spectrophotometric data. The data indicated stronger binding of CHL to the triplex structure of RNA compared to the native duplex structure. Thermal melting studies indicated greater stabilization of the Hoogsteen base paired third strand of the RNA triplex compared to its Watson-Crick strands. The mode of binding of CHL to both U.A*U and A.U was intercalation as revealed from fluorescence quenching, viscosity measurements and sensitization of the fluorescence experiment. Thermodynamic data obtained from isothermal calorimetric measurements revealed that association was favoured by both a negative enthalpy change and a positive entropy change. Taken together, our results suggest that chelerythrine binds and stabilizes the RNA triplex more strongly than its respective parent duplex. The results presented here may be useful for formulating effective antigene strategies involving benzophenanthridine alkaloids and the RNA triplex.

26113220|t|Social network analysis of mating patterns in American black bears (Ursus americanus).
26113220|a|UNASSIGNED: Non-random mating can structure populations and has important implications for population-level processes. Investigating how and why mating deviates from random is important for understanding evolutionary processes as well as informing conservation and management. Prior to the implementation of parentage analyses, understanding mating patterns in solitary, elusive species like bears was virtually impossible. Here we capitalize on a long-term genetic dataset collected from black bears (Ursus americanus) (N=2,422) in the Northern Lower Peninsula (NLP) of Michigan, USA. We identified mated pairs using parentage analysis and applied logistic regression (selection) models that controlled for features of the social network, to quantify the effects of individual characteristics, and spatial and population demographic factors on mating dynamics. Logistic regression models revealed that black bear mating was associated with spatial proximity of mates, male age, the time a pair had coexisted, local population density, and relatedness. Mated pairs were more likely to contain older males. On average, bears tended to mate with nearby individuals to whom they were related, which does not support the existence of kin-recognition in black bears. Pairwise relatedness was especially high for mated pairs containing young males. Restricted dispersal and high male turnover from intensive harvest mortality of NLP black bears are likely the underlying factors associated with younger male bears mating more often with female relatives. Our findings illustrate how harvest has the potential to disrupt the social structure of game species, which warrants further attention for conservation and management.

26113190|t|A simple, physiologically-based model of sea turtle remigration intervals and nesting population dynamics: Effects of temperature.
26113190|a|UNASSIGNED: Variation in the yearly number of sea turtles nesting at rookeries can interfere with population estimates and obscure real population dynamics. Previous theoretical models suggested that this variation in nesting numbers may be driven by changes in resources at the foraging grounds. We developed a physiologically-based model that uses temperatures at foraging sites to predict foraging conditions, resource accumulation, remigration probabilities, and, ultimately, nesting numbers for a stable population of sea turtles. We used this model to explore several scenarios of temperature variation at the foraging grounds, including one-year perturbations and cyclical temperature oscillations. We found that thermally driven resource variation can indeed synchronize nesting in groups of turtles, creating cohorts, but that these cohorts tend to break down over 5-10 years unless regenerated by environmental conditions. Cohorts were broken down faster at lower temperatures. One-year perturbations of low temperature had a synchronizing effect on nesting the following year, while high temperature perturbations tended to delay nesting in a less synchronized way. Cyclical temperatures lead to cyclical responses both in nesting numbers and remigration intervals, with the amplitude and lag of the response depending on the duration of the cycle. Overall, model behavior is consistent with observations at nesting beaches. Future work should focus on refining the model to fit particular nesting populations and testing further whether or not it may be used to predict observed nesting numbers and remigration intervals.

26047759|t|Targeting microbubbles-carrying TGFb1 inhibitor combined with ultrasound sonication induce BBB/BTB disruption to enhance nanomedicine treatment for brain tumors.
26047759|a|UNASSIGNED: The clinical application of chemotherapy for brain cancer tumors remains a challenge due to difficulties in the transport of therapeutic agents across the blood-brain barrier/blood-tumor barrier (BBB/BTB). In this study, we developed des-octanoyl ghrelin-conjugated microbubbles (GMB) loaded with TGFb1 inhibitor (LY364947) (GMBL) to induce BBB/BTB disruption for ultrasound (US) sonication with GMBL. The in-vitro stability study showed that GMB was pretty stable over one month. The in-vivo study showed that the accumulation of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) in the sonicated tumor was significantly higher for focused US sonication in the presence of GMBL, indicating that GMBL/US can locally disrupt BBB/BTB to promote vascular permeability of nanoparticles. In addition, the combination of folate-conjugated polymersomal doxorubicin (FPD) and GMBL/US (FPD+GMBL/US) achieved the best anti-glioma effect and significant improvement in the overall survival time for brain tumor-bearing mice. When combined with focused US, GMBL facilitated local BBB/BTB disruption and simultaneously released LY364947 to decrease the pericyte coverage of the endothelium at the targeted brain tumor sites, resulting in enhanced accumulation and antitumor activity of FPD. The overall results indicate that GMBL/US owns a great potential for non-invasive targeting delivery of nanomedicine across the BBB to treat central nervous system (CNS) diseases.

26113608|t|Characteristics and treatment of patients with G3 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.
26113608|a|UNASSIGNED: Data on gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) G3 (well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET G3) and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC)) are limited. We retrospectively study patients with NET G3 and NEC from 8 European centers. Data examined included clinical and pathological characteristics at diagnosis, therapies and outcomes. 204 patients were analyzed (37 NET G3 and 167 NEC). Median age was 64 (21-89) years. Tumor origin included pancreas (32%) and colon-rectum (27%). The primary tumor was resected in 82 (40%) patients. Metastatic disease was evident at diagnosis in 88% (liver metastases: 67%). Median Ki-67 index was 70% (30% in NET G3 and 80% in NEC; p<0.001). Median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 23 (95% CI: 18-28) months, and significantly higher in NET G3 (99 vs. 17 months in NEC; HR=8.3; P<0.001). Platinum-etoposide first line chemotherapy was administered in 113 (68%) NEC and 12 (32%) NET G3 patients. Disease control rate and progression free survival (PFS) were significantly higher in NEC compared to NET G3 (P<0.05), whereas OS was significantly longer in NET G3 (P=0.003). Second- and third-line therapies (mainly Folfiri and Folfox) were given in 79 and 39 of NEC patients; median PFS and OS were 3.0 and 7.6 months, respectively, after second-line and 2.5 and 6.2 months after third-line chemotherapy. In conclusion, NET G3 and NEC are characterized by significant differences in Ki-67 index and outcomes. While platinum based chemotherapy is effective in NEC, it seems to have limited value in NET G3.

26040651|t|Prognostic factors and follow-up strategy for superficial soft-tissue sarcomas: Analysis of 622 surgically treated patients from the scandinavian sarcoma group register.
26040651|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to describe the clinical outcome of patients with superficial soft-tissue sarcomas (SSTS), define prognostic factors and provide evidence for a rational surveillance scheme. METHODS: Data for 622 consecutive, surgically treated SSTS patients were retrieved from the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group Register. We assessed the rates of local recurrence (LR) and metastasis (M), as well as overall survival (OS), local recurrence free-survival (LRFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) of the cohort. RESULTS: The incidence of LR and M was 9% and 12%, respectively. OS at 5 years was 79%, LRFS was 74% and MFS 76%. Factors that affected OS, LRFS, and MFS were tumor size and patient age. Additionally, tumor grade was an independent prognostic factor for LRFS. The majority of LR and M events were observed the first 2 years of follow-up. Clear surgical margins were correlated to lower risk for LR. Selected patients benefited from adjuvant radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: SSTS have a favourable prognosis, which is mainly determined by tumour-associated factors. Adequate surgical margins are important for local control, whereas radiotherapy has a secondary role. The data support current surveillance schemes, with a closer follow-up the first 2 years after surgery. J. Surg. Oncol. 2015 111:951-956.    2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

26073969|t|3D reconstruction of SEM images by use of optical photogrammetry software.
26073969|a|UNASSIGNED: Reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) surface of an object to be examined is widely used for structure analysis in science and many biological questions require information about their true 3D structure. For Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) there has been no efficient non-destructive solution for reconstruction of the surface morphology to date. The well-known method of recording stereo pair images generates a 3D stereoscope reconstruction of a section, but not of the complete sample surface. We present a simple and non-destructive method of 3D surface reconstruction from SEM samples based on the principles of optical close range photogrammetry. In optical close range photogrammetry a series of overlapping photos is used to generate a 3D model of the surface of an object. We adapted this method to the special SEM requirements. Instead of moving a detector around the object, the object itself was rotated. A series of overlapping photos was stitched and converted into a 3D model using the software commonly used for optical photogrammetry. A rabbit kidney glomerulus was used to demonstrate the workflow of this adaption. The reconstruction produced a realistic and high-resolution 3D mesh model of the glomerular surface. The study showed that SEM micrographs are suitable for 3D reconstruction by optical photogrammetry. This new approach is a simple and useful method of 3D surface reconstruction and suitable for various applications in research and teaching.

26119501|t|Structure-activity relationships of furazano[3,4-b]pyrazines as mitochondrial uncouplers.
26119501|a|UNASSIGNED: Chemical mitochondrial uncouplers are lipophilic weak acids that transport protons into the mitochondrial matrix via a pathway that is independent of ATP synthase, thereby uncoupling nutrient oxidation from ATP production. These uncouplers have potential for the treatment of diseases such as obesity, Parkinson's disease, and aging. We have previously identified a novel mitochondrial protonophore, named BAM15, which stimulates mitochondrial respiration across a broad dosing range compared to carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). Herein, we report our investigations on the structure-activity relationship profile of BAM15. Our studies demonstrate the importance of the furazan, pyrazine, and aniline rings as well as pKa in maintaining its effective protonophore activity.

26121273|t|The serum lipid profiles of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients: A study from south-west China and a meta-analysis.
26121273|a|UNASSIGNED: Associations between the fasting levels of serum lipid and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Chinese populations remain largely unknown. Our objective was to analyse data from a cohort of ALS patients to determine these associations. Four hundred and thirteen ALS patients and 400 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were included. Fasting serum lipid concentration of all subjects, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG), were measured at the time of first visit. The revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) was used to assess the severity of ALS. Systems Analysis by Review Manager 5 was used to evaluate differences in dyslipidaemia between ALS patients and controls. Results showed that ALS patients with higher triglyceride levels had longer survival time compared to patients with lower triglyceride levels (p < 0.05). We found a median prolonged life expectancy of 5.8 months for patients with serum triglyceride levels above the median of 127.5 mg/dl. Cox regression analysis indicated that disease duration and age were positively correlated with death, and triglyceride was positively correlated with survival. A meta-analysis indicated that there were no significant differences in mean total cholesterol, TG, LDL or the LDL/HDL ratio between patients and controls. In conclusion, high serum TG might be a protective factor for the survival of patients with ALS.

26114131|t|Differential Larval Toxicity and Oviposition Altering Activity of Some Indigenous Plant Extracts against Dengue and Chikungunya Vector Aedes albopictus.
26114131|a|BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes are well known as vectors of several disease causing pathogens. The extensive use of synthetic insecticides in the mosquito control strategies resulted to the development of pesticide resistance and fostered environmental deterioration. Hence in recent years plants become alternative source of mosquito control agents. The present study assessed the larvicidal and oviposition altering activity of six different plants species-Alstonia scholaris, Callistemon viminalis, Hyptis suaveolens, Malvastrum coromandelianum, Prosopis juliflora, Vernonia cinerea against Aedes albopictus mosquito in laboratory. METHODS: Leaf extracts of all the six plants species in five different solvents of various polarities were used in the range of 20-400ppm for larval bioassay and 50,100 and 200ppm for cage bioassay (for the study of oviposition behavior) against Ae. albopictus. The larval mortality data were recorded after 24 h and subjected to Probit analysis to determine the lethal concentrations (LC50), while OAI (Oviposition activity index) was calculated for oviposition altering activity of the plant extracts. RESULTS: Vernonia cinerea extract in acetone and C. viminalis extract in isopropanol were highly effective against Aedes albopictus larvae with LC50 value 64.57, 71.34ppm respectively. Acetone extract of P. juliflora found to be strong oviposition-deterrent which inhibited >2 fold egg laying (OAI-0.466) at 100ppm. CONCLUSION: Vernonia cinerea and C. viminallis leaf extracts have the potential to be used as larvicide and P. juliflora as an oviposition-deterrent for the control of Ae. albopictus mosquito.

26031711|t|Phage T4-induced DNA breaks activate a tRNA repair-defying anticodon nuclease.
26031711|a|UNASSIGNED: The natural role of the conserved bacterial anticodon nuclease (ACNase) RloC is not known, but traits that set it apart from the homologous phage T4-excluding ACNase PrrC could provide relevant clues. PrrC is silenced by a genetically linked DNA restriction-modification (RM) protein and turned on by a phage-encoded DNA restriction inhibitor. In contrast, RloC is rarely linked to an RM protein, and its ACNase is regulated by an internal switch responsive to double-stranded DNA breaks. Moreover, PrrC nicks the tRNA substrate, whereas RloC excises the wobble nucleotide. These distinctions suggested that (i) T4 and related phage that degrade their host DNA will activate RloC and (ii) the tRNA species consequently disrupted will not be restored by phage tRNA repair enzymes that counteract PrrC. Consistent with these predictions we show that Acinetobacter baylyi   RloC expressed in Escherichia coli is activated by wild-type phage T4 but not by a mutant impaired in host DNA degradation. Moreover, host and T4 tRNA species disrupted by the activated ACNase were not restored by T4's tRNA repair system. Nonetheless, T4's plating efficiency was inefficiently impaired by AbaRloC, presumably due to a decoy function of the phage encoded tRNA target, the absence of which exacerbated the restriction.

26121149|t|Gene Expression Profiling of H9c2 Myoblast Differentiation towards a Cardiac-Like Phenotype.
26121149|a|UNASSIGNED: H9c2 myoblasts are a cell model used as an alternative for cardiomyocytes. H9c2 cells have the ability to differentiate towards a cardiac phenotype when the media serum is reduced in the presence of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), creating multinucleated cells with low proliferative capacity. In the present study, we performed for the first time a transcriptional analysis of the H9c2 cell line in two differentiation states, i.e. embryonic cells and differentiated cardiac-like cells. The results show that RA-induced H9c2 differentiation increased the expression of genes encoding for cardiac sarcomeric proteins such as troponin T, or calcium transporters and associated machinery, including SERCA2, ryanodine receptor and phospholamban as well as genes associated with mitochondrial energy production including respiratory chain complexes subunits, mitochondrial creatine kinase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and uncoupling proteins. Undifferentiated myoblasts showed increased gene expression of pro-survival proteins such as Bcl-2 as well as cell cycle-regulating proteins. The results indicate that the differentiation of H9c2 cells lead to an increase of transcripts and protein levels involved in calcium handling, glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, confirming that H9c2 cell differentiation induced by RA towards a more cardiac-like phenotype involves remodeled mitochondrial function. PI3K, PDK1 and p-CREB also appear to be involved on H9c2 differentiation. Furthermore, complex analysis of differently expressed transcripts revealed significant up-regulation of gene expression related to cardiac muscle contraction, dilated cardiomyopathy and other pathways specific for the cardiac tissue.

26113504|t|Comparison of two- and three-point sutures for advancing the levator aponeurosis in Asian eyelids.
26113504|a|UNASSIGNED: PurposeTo compare the functional and cosmetic outcomes of two- and three-point sutures for advancing the levator aponeurosis in blepharoptosis surgery on Asians.Patients and methodsThis retrospective study examined 60 Asian patients with blepharoptosis who had undergone advancement of the levator aponeurosis: 34 patients (46 eyelids) had ptosis correction using the two-point suture technique and 26 patients (41 eyelids) had ptosis correction using the three-point suture technique. The postoperative marginal reflex distance (MRD1), lid height difference, and eyelid contour were evaluated.ResultsTwenty-seven (79.4%) of the 34 patients in the two-point group and 19 (73.1%) of 26 patients in the three-point group had a postoperative MRD1 of 2-4   mm, lids within 0.5   mm of each other, and a satisfactory eyelid contour; this difference was not significant. The rate of reoperation did not differ significantly between the two groups.ConclusionTwo- and three-point sutures for advancing the levator aponeurosis were equally effective for correcting blepharoptosis in Asians.Eye advance online publication, 26 June 2015; doi:10.1038/eye.2015.107.

26075516|t|Behavioral and Trait Rating Assessments of Personality in Common Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).
26075516|a|UNASSIGNED: The study of personality in animals is a rapidly growing scientific field and numerous species have been reported to show consistent personality profiles. Much animal personality research has focused on nonhuman primates, with the main emphasis being placed on Old World primates, particularly rhesus macaques and chimpanzees. So far, little work has been done on cooperatively breeding nonhuman primates and New World species. Here, we study personality in the cooperatively breeding common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) to broaden the taxonomic range of such research and to widen the perspective of comparative personality research. We use behavioral data collection and observer trait ratings to assess marmoset personality dimensions. The resulting behavioral and rating-derived personality dimensions, when viewed in tandem, resemble the human five-factor model and include extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and conscientiousness. Correlations between the behavioral data and the observer trait-rated personality components suggest that the personality construct of common marmosets exhibits both convergent and discriminant validity. The finding of a distinct Conscientiousness component in this species extends previous knowledge in comparative personality psychology and warrants reconsideration of proposed taxonomic trait distributions.

26072343|t|Sleep-Dependent Memory Consolidation in Children.
26072343|a|UNASSIGNED: In the past 30 years, much research has been conducted elucidating the role of sleep in memory and learning; however, the interaction between sleep and cognitive functioning may be unknown in clinical realms. This article serves to provide a primer on sleep-dependent memory consolidation, a process in which memory is stabilized or even enhanced over a period of sleep. Given the increased amounts of sleep needed in infancy and childhood, the link between sleep and neuronal plasticity is highlighted in this article. Furthermore, sleep disruptions are common to children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; thus, recent studies showing direct relationships between sleep and memory functioning in such vulnerable groups are discussed.

26074427|t|Embryonic catalase protects against ethanol embryopathies in acatalasemic mice and transgenic human catalase-expressing mice in embryo culture.
26074427|a|UNASSIGNED: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in the mechanism of ethanol (EtOH) teratogenicity, but the protective role of the embryonic antioxidative enzyme catalase is unclear, as embryonic activity is only about 5% of maternal levels. We addressed this question in a whole embryo culture model. C57BL/6 mouse embryos expressing human catalase (hCat) or their wild-type (C57BL/6 WT) controls, and C3Ga.Cg-Cat(b)/J catalase-deficient, acatalasemic (aCat) mouse embryos or their wild-type C3HeB/FeJ (C3H WT) controls, were explanted on gestational day (GD) 9 (plug=GD 1), exposed for 24hr to 2 or 4mg/mL EtOH or vehicle, and evaluated for functional and morphological changes. hCat and C57BL/6 WT vehicle-exposed embryos developed normally, while EtOH was embryopathic in C57BL/6 WT embryos, evidenced by decreases in anterior neuropore closure, somites developed, turning and head length, whereas hCat embryos were protected (p<0.001). Maternal pretreatment of C57BL/6 WT dams with 50 kU/kg PEG-catalase (PEG-cat) 8hr prior to embryo culture, which increases embryonic catalase activity, blocked all EtOH embryopathies (p<0.001). Vehicle-exposed aCat mouse embryos had lower yolk sac diameters compared to WT controls, suggesting endogenous ROS are embryopathic. EtOH was more embryopathic in aCat embryos than WT controls, evidenced by reduced head length and somite development (p<0.01), and trends for reduced anterior neuropore closure, turning and crown-rump length. Maternal pretreatment of aCat dams with PEG-Cat blocked all EtOH embryopathies (p<0.05). These data suggest that embryonic catalase is a determinant of risk for EtOH embryopathies.

26116880|t|MicroRNAs in liver tissue engineering - New promises for failing organs.
26116880|a|UNASSIGNED: miRNA-based technologies provide attractive tools for several liver tissue engineering approaches. Herein, we review the current state of miRNA applications in liver tissue engineering. Several miRNAs have been implicated in hepatic disease and proper hepatocyte function. However, the clinical translation of these findings into tissue engineering has just begun. miRNAs have been successfully used to induce proliferation of mature hepatocytes and improve the differentiation of hepatic precursor cells. Nonetheless, miRNA-based approaches beyond cell generation have not yet entered preclinical or clinical investigations. Moreover, miRNA-based concepts for the biliary tree have yet to be developed. Further research on miRNA based modifications, however, holds the promise of enabling significant improvements to liver tissue engineering approaches due to their ability to regulate and fine-tune all biological processes relevant to hepatic tissue engineering, such as proliferation, differentiation, growth, and cell function.

26117475|t|A study of adherence to DOTS regimen among pulmonary tuberculosis patients in West Tripura District.
26117475|a|BACKGROUND: Noncompliance to the DOTS regimen leads to treatment failure, relapse, MDR tuberculosis, XDR tuberculosis etc. requiring more prolonged _ expensive therapy. AIM: To assess the adherence rate among pulmonary tuberculosis patients in west Tripura district and to study the factors affecting adherence to DOTS regimen among pulmonary tuberculosis patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This community based cross-sectional study was conducted among 220 pulmonary tuberculosis patients registered for treatment with DOTS therapy; under six randomly selected DMC of West Tripura District. RESULTS: The study revealed that the adherence rate among the pulmonary TB patients was 84.50 percent. Male tuberculosis patients had 87.10 percent less chance of being adherent to the DOTS regimen in reference to females, and Cat I patients were 8.96 times (C.I. 2.689-29.857) more adherent to the therapy compared to the retreatment cases. Again, patients whose continuation phase was supervised as per the guidelines of DOTS were 12.07 times more adherent to the therapy. PTB patients who had the knowledge of supervised therapy in DOTS and curability of the disease, were 4.70 times (C.I. 1.39-15.79) and 9.39 times (C.I. 1.03-85.99) more adherent to the therapy, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study showed good adherence to the regimen among pulmonary tuberculosis patients in spite of being a difficult area. It may also help in planning and implementation of tuberculosis control measures by addressing and overcoming the barriers regarding treatment completion.

26116842|t|Efficacy of different methods used for dry socket management: A systematic review.
26116842|a|BACKGROUND: Dry socket is one of the most common complications occurring after the extraction of a permanent tooth, but in spite of its high incidence there is not an established treatment for this condition. OBJECTIVES: Analyze the efficacy of different methods used in the management of dry socket regarding results of pain's relief and alveolar mucosa healing compared to conventional surgical treatment of curettage and saline irrigation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Cochrane and PubMed-MEDLINE database search was conducted with the search terms "dry socket", "post-extraction complications", "alvogyl", "alveolar osteitis" and "fibrynolitic alveolitis", individually and next, using the Boolean operator "AND". The inclusion criteria were: clinical studies including at least 10 patients, articles published from 2004 to 2014 written in English. The exclusion criteria were case reports and nonhuman studies. RESULTS: 11 publications were selected from a total of 627. Three of the 11 were excluded after reading the full text. The final review included 8 articles: 3 prospective studies, 2 retrospective studies and 3 clinical trials. They were stratified according to their level of scientific evidence using the SORT criteria (Strenght of Recommendation Taxonomy). CONCLUSIONS: All treatments included in the review have the aim to relief patient's pain and promote alveolar mucosa healing in dry socket. Given the heterogeneity of interventions and the type of measurement scale, the results are difficult to compare. Curettage and irrigation should be carried out in dry socket, as well as another therapy such as LLLT, zinc oxide eugenol or plasma rich in growth factors, which are the ones that show better results in pain remission and alveolar mucosa healing. Assessment alveolar bone esposure must be a factor to consider in future research. Taking into account the scientific quality of the articles evaluated, a level B recommendation is given for therapeutic interventions proposed for the treatment of dry socket.

26117781|t|Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 affects osteogenic efficacy on dental implants in rat mandible.
26117781|a|UNASSIGNED: Insulin like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in bone cells and its utilization in dental implants have not been well studied. The aim of this study was to determine the osteogenic efficacy of chitosan gold nanoparticles (Ch-GNPs) conjugated with IGFBP-3 coated titanium (Ti) implants. Ch-GNPs were conjugated with IGFBP-3 plasmid DNA through a coacervation process. Conjugation was cast over Ti surfaces, and cells were seeded on coated surfaces. For in vitro analysis the expression of different proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting. For in vivo analysis, Ch-GNP/IGFBP-3 coated implants were installed in rat mandibles. Four weeks post-implantation, mandibles were examined by microcomputed tomography ( CT), immunohistochemistry, hematoxylin _ eosin and tartrate resistance acid phosphatase staining. In vitro overexpressed Ch-GNP/IGFBP-3 coated Ti surfaces was associated with activation of extracellular signal related kinase (ERK), inhibition of the stress activated protein c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and enhanced bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and 7 compared to control. Further, in vivo, Ch-GNP/IGFBP-3 coated implants were associated with inhibition of implant induced osteoclastogenesis molecules, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and enhanced expression of osteogenic molecules including BMP2/7 and osteopontin (OPN). The  CT analysis demonstrated that IGFBP-3 increased the volume of newly formed bone surrounding the implants compared to control (n=5; p<0.05). These results support the view that IGFBP-3 overexpression diminishes osteoclastogenesis and enhances osteogenesis of Ti implants, and can serve as a potent molecule for the development of good implantation.

26117296|t|Avoiding Complications in Endoscopic Sinus Surgery.
26117296|a|UNASSIGNED: Complications of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) can range from the mundane to the catastrophic, with nasal hemorrhage being the most common. Intraorbital and intracranial complications are much less common. Despite the rarity of complications, they are often avoidable. Certain identifiable risk factors can be appreciated during the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative evaluations of the sinus patient. With awareness of these risk factors the rhinologist can develop a strategic plan of risk factor mitigation.

26101830|t|Glycine transporter GlyT1, but not GlyT2, is expressed in rat dorsal root ganglion-Possible implications for neuropathic pain.
26101830|a|UNASSIGNED: Glycinergic inhibitory neurotransmission plays a pivotal role in the development of neuropathic pain. The glycine concentration in the synaptic cleft is controlled by the glycine transporters GlyT1 and GlyT2. GlyT1 is expressed throughout the central nervous system, while GlyT2 is exclusively located in glycinergic neurons. Aim of the present study was to investigate whether GlyTs are also expressed in the peripheral sensory nervous system and whether their expression is modulated in experimental neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain was induced in male Wistar rats by Chronic Constriction Injury (CCI) and verified by assessment of mechanical allodynia (von Frey method). Expression patterns of GlyTs and the glycine binding subunit NR1 of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were analyzed by Western blot analysis, PCR and immunohistochemistry. While both GlyT1 and GlyT2 were detected in the spinal cord, only GlyT1, but not GlyT2, was detected in DRG. Immunofluorescence revealed a strictly neuronal localization of GlyT1 and a co-localization of GlyT1 and NR1 in DRG. Compared to sham procedure, spinal cord and DRG expression of GlyT1 was not altered and NR1 was unchanged in DRG 12 days after CCI. GlyT1, but not GlyT2, is expressed in the peripheral sensory nervous system. The co-expression of GlyT1 and NMDA receptors in DRG suggests that GlyT1 regulates glycine concentration at the glycine binding site of the NMDA receptor. Differential regulation of GlyT1 expression in the spinal cord or DRG, however, does not seem to be associated with the development of neuropathic pain.

26116454|t|In vitro antimicrobial synergy studies of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from intensive care units of a tertiary care hospital in Egypt.
26116454|a|UNASSIGNED: The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant and pan drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii as a cause of nosocomial infections has led to the need for the reassessment of novel combinations of antibiotics as our only current viable option for handling such infections until a new therapeutic option becomes available. Two of the most commonly used methods for testing antimicrobial synergy are the Time-kill assay method and the E-test method, and these were the methods used in this study. Antibiotic combinations tested in this study were azithromycin and polymyxin, tobramycin and polymyxin, polymyxin and rifampicin, and tobramycin and rifampicin. The azithromycin and polymyxin combination showed synergy, while the rifampicin and polymyxin combination showed antagonism. The synergy was achieved at lower MIC values than using each of the single agents alone against the same isolates. Synergy testing results varied according to the method used, and it is difficult to establish which method is more accurate. The use of these lower MIC values as a guide to determine effective therapeutic doses used in combination therapy can help to decrease the emergence of resistance and can also minimize the side effects associated with using a single agent at a higher dose. Further research is still required to predict in vivo efficacy of such combinations.

26119042|t|Formulation of attractive toxic sugar bait (ATSB) with safe EPA-exempt substance significantly diminishes the Anopheles sergentii population in a desert oasis.
26119042|a|UNASSIGNED: Attractive toxic sugar bait (ATSB) is a highly effective method which targets mosquitoes based on their sugar foraging behavior, by presenting baits of attractive compounds in combination with sugar and oral toxin to local mosquito populations. Environmental concerns and insecticide selection-pressure have prompted investigations of novel, ecologically-harmless substances which can be used as insecticides. This study examined the efficacy of microencapsulated garlic-oil as the oral toxin component of ATSB for controlling An. sergentii populations inhabiting desert-surrounded wetlands in Israel. ATSB solution containing 0.4% encapsulated garlic oil was applied to local vegetation around a streamlet located in the lower Jordan Valley. To determine the propensity of bait ingestion, and assess the potential ecological impact of the method, mosquito and non-target specimens were collected and tested for the presence of natural plant- or attractive sugar bait (ASB)-derived sugars. Over the experimental period, biting-pressure values in the ATSB treatment site decreased by 97.5%, while at the control site, treated with non-toxic ASB, no significant changes were observed. Approximately 70% of the mosquitoes collected before both treatments, as well as those captured following the application of ASB at the control site, were found to have ingested sugar prior to capture. Non-target insects were minimally affected by the treatment when ATSB was applied to foliage of non-flowering plants. Of the non-Diptera species, only 0.7% of the sampled non-target insects were found to have ingested ASB-solution which was applied to green vegetation, compared with 8.5% which have foraged on ASB-derived sugars applied to flowering plants. Conversely, a high proportion of the non-target species belonging to the order Diptera, especially non-biting midges, were found to have ingested foliage-applied ASB, with more than 36% of the specimens collected determined to have foraged on bait-derived sugars. These results prove that food-grade, EPA-exempt microencapsulated garlic oil is a highly effective insecticide which can be utilized for mosquito population control. The relatively short half-life of this active ingredient makes it a suitable for use in areas where repeated application is possible, limiting the accumulation of deleterious compounds and ensuring minimal environmental impact when applied in accordance with label recommendations.

26120325|t|Two Oral Midazolam Preparations in Pediatric Dental Patients: A Prospective Randomised Clinical Trial.
26120325|a|Pharmacological sedation is an alternative behavior management strategy in pediatric dentistry. The aim of this study was to compare the behavioral and physiologic effects of "commercially midazolam syrup" versus "orally administered IV midazolam dosage form (extemporaneous midazolam (EF))" in uncooperative pediatric dental patients. Eighty-eight children between 4 to 7 years of age received 0.2-0.5   mg/kg midazolam in this parallel trial. Physiologic parameters were recorded at baseline and every 15 minutes. Behavior assessment was conducted objectively by Houpt scale throughout the sedation and North Carolina at baseline and during injection and cavity preparation. No significant difference in behavior was noted by Houpt or North Carolina scale. Acceptable behavior (excellent, very good, and good) was observed in 90.9% of syrup and 79.5% of EF subjects, respectively. Physiological parameters remained in normal range without significant difference between groups and no adverse effect was observed. It is concluded that EF midazolam preparation can be used as an acceptable alternative to midazolam syrup.

26042771|t|Optimal Central Obesity Measurement Site for Assessing Cardiometabolic and Type 2 Diabetes Risk in Middle-Aged Adults.
26042771|a|OBJECTIVES: Despite recommendations that central obesity assessment should be employed as a marker of cardiometabolic health, no consensus exists regarding measurement protocol. This study examined a range of anthropometric variables and their relationships with cardiometabolic features and type 2 diabetes in order to ascertain whether measurement site influences discriminatory accuracy. In particular, we compared waist circumference (WC) measured at two sites: (1) immediately below the lowest rib (WC rib) and (2) between the lowest rib and iliac crest (WC midway), which has been recommended by the World Health Organisation and International Diabetes Federation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving a random sample of 2,002 men and women aged 46-73 years. Metabolic profiles and WC, hip circumference, pelvic width and body mass index (BMI) were determined. Correlation, logistic regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to evaluate obesity measurement relationships with metabolic risk phenotypes and type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: WC rib measures displayed the strongest associations with non-optimal lipid and lipoprotein levels, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, impaired fasting glucose, a clustering of metabolic risk features and type 2 diabetes, in both genders. Rib-derived indices improved discrimination of type 2 diabetes by 3-7% compared to BMI and 2-6% compared to WC midway (in men) and 5-7% compared to BMI and 4-6% compared to WC midway (in women). A prediction model including BMI and central obesity displayed a significantly higher area under the curve for WC rib (0.78, P=0.003), Rib/height ratio (0.80, P<0.001), Rib/pelvis ratio (0.79, P<0.001), but not for WC midway (0.75, P=0.127), when compared to one with BMI alone (0.74). CONCLUSIONS: WC rib is easier to assess and our data suggest that it is a better method for determining obesity-related cardiometabolic risk than WC midway. The clinical utility of rib-derived indices, or alternative WC measurements, deserves further investigation.

26044297|t|Inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes using Water Bath Heat Treatment in Vacuum Packed Ricotta Salata Cheese Wedges.
26044297|a|UNASSIGNED: Ricotta salata cheese is frequently contaminated on the surface with Listeria monocytogenes. Water bath heat treatment in vacuum packed whole ricotta salata cheese wheels demonstrated to be effective in inactivating L. monocytogenes. However, the risk of cross-contamination in ricotta salata wedges is increased during cheese cutting. Therefore, the effectiveness of heat treatment in ricotta salata wedges has to be demonstrated conducting a new validation study. In this study, 9 different time temperature combinations, 75, 85, and 90    C applied for 10, 20, and 30 min each, were tested on artificially contaminated ricotta salata cheese wedges. The extent of the lethal effect on L. monocytogenes was assessed 1 and 30 d after the application of the hot water bath treatment. Five of 9 combinations, 75    C for 30 min, 85    C for 20, and 30 min, and 90  C for 20 and 30 min, demonstrated to meet the process criteria of at least 5 log reduction. Sensory analyses were also conducted in order to account for the potential impact on sensory features of ricotta salata wedges, which showed no significant differences between treatments.

26048837|t|(1)H NMR and HPLC/DAD for Cannabis sativa L. chemotype distinction, extract profiling and specification.
26048837|a|The medicinal use of different chemovars and extracts of Cannabis sativa L. requires standardization beyond    9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with complementing methods. We investigated the suitability of (1)H NMR key signals for distinction of four chemotypes measured in deuterated dimethylsulfoxide together with two new validated HPLC/DAD methods used for identification and extract profiling based on the main pattern of cannabinoids and other phenolics alongside the assayed content of THC, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG) their acidic counterparts (THCA, CBDA, CBGA), cannabinol (CBN) and cannflavin A and B. Effects on cell viability (MTT assay, HeLa) were tested. The dominant cannabinoid pairs allowed chemotype recognition via assignment of selective proton signals and via HPLC even in cannabinoid-low extracts from the THC, CBD and CBG type. Substantial concentrations of cannabinoid acids in non-heated extracts suggest their consideration for total values in chemotype distinction and specifications of herbal drugs and extracts. Cannflavin A/B are extracted and detected together with cannabinoids but always subordinated, while other phenolics can be accumulated via fractionation and detected in a wide fingerprint but may equally serve as qualitative marker only. Cell viability reduction in HeLa was more determined by the total cannabinoid content than by the specific cannabinoid profile. Therefore the analysis and labeling of total cannabinoids together with the content of THC and 2-4 lead cannabinoids are considered essential. The suitability of analytical methods and the range of compound groups summarized in group and ratio markers are discussed regarding plant classification and pharmaceutical specification.

26097706|t|Ingestion of coffee polyphenols increases postprandial release of the active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1(7-36)) amide in C57BL/6J mice.
26097706|a|UNASSIGNED: The widespread prevalence of diabetes, caused by impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance, is now a worldwide health problem. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a major intestinal hormone that stimulates glucose-induced insulin secretion from b cells. Prolonged activation of the GLP-1 signal has been shown to attenuate diabetes in animals and human subjects. Therefore, GLP-1 secretagogues are attractive targets for the treatment of diabetes. Recent epidemiological studies have reported that an increase in daily coffee consumption lowers diabetes risk. The present study examined the hypothesis that the reduction in diabetes risk associated with coffee consumption may be mediated by the stimulation of GLP-1 release by coffee polyphenol extract (CPE). GLP-1 secretion by human enteroendocrine NCI-H716 cells was augmented in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of CPE, and was compatible with the increase in observed active GLP-1(7-36) amide levels in the portal blood after administration with CPE alone in mice. CPE increased intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in a dose-dependent manner, but this was not mediated by G protein-coupled receptor 119 (GPR119). The oral administration of CPE increased diet (starch and glyceryl trioleate)-induced active GLP-1 secretion and decreased glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide release. Although CPE administration did not affect diet-induced insulin secretion, it decreased postprandial hyperglycaemia, which indicates that higher GLP-1 levels after the ingestion of CPE may improve insulin sensitivity. We conclude that dietary coffee polyphenols augment gut-derived active GLP-1 secretion via the cAMP-dependent pathway, which may contribute to the reduced risk of type 2 diabetes associated with daily coffee consumption.

26097236|t|C5a inducing tissue factor expressing microparticles and neutrophil extracellular traps promote hypercoagulability in ANCA-associated vasculitis.
26097236|a|UNASSIGNED: [Objective] Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis (AAV) has high frequency of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) and a hypercoagulable state. As C5a primed neutrophils play an important role in the development of AAV, we aimed to investigate that C5a induced neutrophils tissue factor (TF) expressing microparticles (MPs) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) might promote hypercoagulability in AAV. [Methods] TF expressing MPs were measured by flow cytometry. TF expressing NETs were assessed by confocal microscopy. Thrombin-antithrombin complex levels were tested by ELISA. The effect of C5a in sera from AAV patients was proved through treating neutrophils with C5a receptor antagonist before incubating with sera from AAV patients with active disease. [Results] Treatment of C5a primed neutrophils with ANCA-positive IgG resulted in the release of TF bearing MPs and NETs. Neutrophils from healthy donors treated with sera from patients with active AAV released TF bearing MPs and NETs which were abolished with C5a receptor antagonist. TF implication in MP or NETs dependent thrombin generation was demonstrated by antibody neutralization studies. NETs with thrombin-generating capacity were demonstrated by DNase I. [Conclusion] C5a primed neutrophils produce TF expressing MPs and NETs after ANCAs stimulation, providing a novel mechanism for hypercoagulability in AAV. This article is protected by copyright.

26012534|t|Hydrodynamic and Thermophoretic Effects on the Supramolecular Chirality of Pyrene-Derived Nanosheets.
26012534|a|UNASSIGNED: Chiroptical properties of two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular assemblies (nanosheets) of achiral, charged pyrene trimers (Py3 ) are rendered chiral by asymmetric physical perturbations. Chiral stimuli in a cuvette can originate either from controlled temperature gradients or by very gentle stirring. The chiroptical activity strongly depends on the degree of supramolecular order of the nanosheets, which is easily controlled by the method of preparation. The high degree of structural order ensures strong cooperative effects within the aggregates, rendering them more susceptible to external stimuli. The samples prepared by using slow thermal annealing protocols are both CD and LD active (in stagnant and stirred solutions), whereas for isothermally aged samples chiroptical activity was in all cases undetectable. In the case of temperature gradients, the optical activity of 2D assemblies could be recorded for a stagnant solution due to migration of the aggregates from the hottest to the coldest regions of the system. However, a considerably stronger exciton coupling, coinciding with the J-band of the interacting pyrenes, is developed upon subtle vortexing (0.5   Hz, 30   rpm) of the aqueous solution of the nanosheets. The sign of the exciton coupling is inverted upon switching between clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation. The supramolecular chirality is evidenced by the appearance of CD activity. To exclude artefacts from proper CD spectra, the contribution from LD to the observed CD was determined. The data suggest that the aggregates experience asymmetrical deformation and alignment effects because of the presence of chiral flows.

26095120|t|Spontaneous Hemopericardium in a Patient Receiving Apixaban Therapy: First Case Report.
26095120|a|UNASSIGNED: Apixaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, is a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) indicated for prevention of embolic events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The agent is associated with a lower risk of bleeding compared with vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin. Hemopericardium is a life-threatening bleeding event that is rarely caused by anticoagulants. We describe the case of a 76-year-old woman who was diagnosed with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and treated with apixaban. Six weeks later, she was hospitalized after complaints of weakness and dizziness, and a chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly. Further imaging, including a computed tomography scan and transthoracic echocardiogram, confirmed a diagnosis of hemopericardium. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of hemopericardium associated with apixaban therapy. This report, along with two previous cases reports of hemopericardium associated with dabigatran and rivaroxaban, emphasizes the need for careful use of NOACs and for further research to identify an antidote or other method for controlling hemorrhage secondary to NOACs in an acute setting. Furthermore, clinicians should consider hemopericardium in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with anticoagulants, including NOACs, who present with cardiomegaly.

The catalyst combines two elements of chirality, a chiral pybox ligand and a chiral bicylic lactam unit, to which the ligand is attached. The latter unit was shown to improve significantly the performance of the catalyst by exposing one of the two enantiotopic sulfur atoms to the active site via hydrogen-bond mediated coordination. Ten differently substituted substrates were converted into the respective sulfoxides in yields of 52-71   % and with >= 90   % ee.

CD326 (epithelial-specific antigen, clone Ber-Ep4) was used to identify epithelial cells, CD45 to discriminate between leucocytes (positive for this antigen) and non-hematological cells (negative for this antigen), and CD33 to identify monocytes/macrophages. This combination is particularly useful in effusions to characterize large cells and distinguish between monocyte/macrophages (CD45+ CD33+ CD326-), mesothelial cells (CD45 -/+(dim) CD33 - CD326 -) and epithelial cells (CD45 - CD33 - CD326 +). We evaluated the efficiency of flow cytometry to detect malignant epithelial cells in 238 fresh samples, including effusions, lymph node biopsies, fine needle aspirates, bone marrow aspirates, cerebrospinal fluid, among others. These are specimens expected to lack epithelial cells. FCM results were then compared to the results of smear and cell block morphology, as well as immunocytochemistry on paraffin wax embedded cell blocks, when available. Final diagnosis was the gold standard and a very good sensitivity (96.7%) and specificity (99.3%) were obtained. We concluded that the detection of CD326 positive cells using FCM is strongly indicative of the presence of carcinoma cells. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

26010035|t|Complete Remodeling after Conservative Treatment of a Severely Angulated Odontoid Fracture in a Patient with Osteogenesis Imperfecta: A Case Report.
26010035|a|STUDY DESIGN:                 <AbstractText Label="CASE REPORT" NlmCategory="METHODS"/>                <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">This is the first case report describing successful healing and remodeling of a traumatic odontoid fracture that was dislocated and severely angulated in an osteogenesis imperfecta patient who was treated conservatively. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare genetic disorder resulting in a low bone mass and bone fragility, predisposing these patients to fractures that often occur at a young age. Although any bone in the body may be involved, odontoid fractures are uncommon in this population. Because of a very high fusion rate, conservative management is accepted as a safe and efficient treatment for fractures of the odontoid in children. Several authors, however, recommend surgical treatment for patients who have failure of conservative treatment and have severe angulation or displacement of the odontoid. METHODS: A 5-year-old girl, diagnosed with OI type I, presented with neck pain without any neurological deficits after falling out of a rocking chair backward with her head landing first on the ground. Computed tomography confirmed a type III odontoid fracture without dislocation and she was initially treated with a rigid cervical orthosis. At 1 and 2 months follow-up, progressive severe angulation of the odontoid was observed but conservative treatment was maintained as the space available for the spinal cord was sufficient and also considering the patient's history of OI. RESULTS: Eight months post injury she had no clinical symptoms and there was osseous healing of the fracture with remodeling of the odontoid to normal morphology. CONCLUSION: Even in patients with OI, severely angulated odontoid fractures might have the capacity for osseous healing and complete remodeling under conservative treatment.

26007223|t|A comprehensive assay for nine major cytochrome P450 enzymes activities with 16 probe reactions on human liver microsomes by a single LC/MS/MS run to support reliable in vitro inhibitory drug-drug interaction evaluation.
26007223|a|UNASSIGNED: 1.   A comprehensive method for the simultaneous characterization of xenobiotic compound inhibition of nine major CYP enzymes in human liver microsomes was established by using 16 CYP-catalyzed reactions of 14 probe substrates with three cocktail incubation sets and a single LC/MS/MS analysis. 2.   The three cocktail subgroups were developed to minimize the effects of organic solvents, polyunsaturated fatty acids and mutual substrate interactions: Group I was composed of tolbutamide (CYP2C9), S-mephenytoin (CYP2C19), testosterone (CYP3A4), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6); Group II was composed of nifedipine (CYP3A4), midazolam (CYP3A4), coumarin (CYP2A6), bupropion (CYP2B6), diclofenac (CYP2C9); Group III was composed of phenacetin (CYP1A2), chlorzoxazone (CYP2E1), omeprazole (CYP2C19 and CYP3A4), paclitaxel (CYP2C8), (+)-bufuralol (CYP2D6). In the case of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, multiple probe substrates were used due to the phenomenon of multiple substrate-binding pockets and substrate-dependent inhibition. All probe metabolites were simultaneously analyzed with a polarity switching mode in a single LC/MS/MS run. 3.   This method was validated against the single probe substrate assay using 12 well-characterized CYP inhibitors and two new entities (GT0918, MDV3100). The IC50 values of each inhibitor in the cocktail agreed well with that of the individual probe drug as well as with values reported in previous literatures.

26047142|t|Laser-induced thermoelastic effects can evoke tactile sensations.
26047142|a|UNASSIGNED: Humans process a plethora of sensory information that is provided by various entities in the surrounding environment. Among the five major senses, technology for touch, haptics, is relatively young and has relatively limited applications largely due to its need for physical contact. In this article, we suggest a new way for non-contact haptic stimulation that uses laser, which has potential advantages such as mid-air stimulation, high spatial precision, and long working distance. We demonstrate such tactile stimulation can be enabled by laser-induced thermoelastic effects by means of physical and perceptual studies, as well as simulations. In the physical study, the mechanical effect of laser on a human skin sample is detected using low-power radiation in accordance with safety guidelines. Limited increases (< ~2.5     C) in temperature at the surface of the skin, examined by both thermal camera and the Monte Carlo simulation, indicate that laser does not evoke heat-induced nociceptive sensation. In the human EEG study, brain responses to both mechanical and laser stimulation are consistent, along with subjective reports of the non-nociceptive sensation of laser stimuli.

26049603|t|Evaluation of Team-Based Care in an Urban Free Clinic Setting.
26049603|a|UNASSIGNED: This article reports the experiences of a school of nursing, academic health center, and community-based organization working via an interprofessional collaborative practice model to meet the mutual goal of serving the health care needs of an indigent, largely minority population in Birmingham, Alabama. The population suffers disproportionately from chronic health problems including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and mental health disorders. The program emphasizes diabetes management because the academic health center recognized the need for transitional and primary care, including mental health services, for the increasing numbers of uninsured patients with diabetes and its comorbidities. Half of the clinicians involved in this project had no prior experience with interprofessional collaborative practice, and there was confusion regarding the roles of team members from the partnering institutions. Activities involving care coordination consistently received low scores on weekly rating scales leading to the creation of positions for a nurse care manager and pharmaceutical patient assistance program coordinator. Conversely, shared decision making and cooperation ratings were consistently high. Evaluation identified the need for reliable, accessible data and data analysis to target clinically effective interventions and care coordination and to assess cost effectiveness. The strengths, challenges, lessons learned, and next steps required for sustainability of this alignment are discussed.

26008887|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the clinical efficacy of regenerative periodontal surgery of intrabony defects using a combination of enamel matrix derivative (EMD) and bone graft compared with that of EMD alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Cochrane Oral Health Group specialist trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases were searched for entries up to February 2014. The primary outcome was gain of clinical attachment (CAL). Weighted means and forest plots were calculated for CAL gain, probing depth (PD), and gingival recession (REC). RESULTS: Twelve studies reporting on 434 patients and 548 intrabony defects were selected for the analysis. Mean CAL gain amounted to 3.76        1.07  mm (median 3.63 95  % CI 3.51-3.75) following treatment with a combination of EMD and bone graft and to 3.32        1.04  mm (median 3.40; 95  % CI 3.28-3.52) following treatment with EMD alone. Mean PD reduction measured 4.22        1.20  mm (median 4.10; 95  % CI 3.96-4.24) at sites treated with EMD and bone graft and yielded 4.12        1.07  mm (median 4.00; 95  % CI 3.88-4.12) at sites treated with EMD alone. Mean REC increase amounted to 0.76        0.42  mm (median 0.63; 95  % CI 0.58-0.68) at sites treated with EMD and bone graft and to 0.91        0.26  mm (median 0.90; 95  % CI 0.87-0.93) at sites treated with EMD alone. CONCLUSIONS: Within their limits, the present results indicate that the combination of EMD and bone grafts may result in additional clinical improvements in terms of CAL gain and PD reduction compared with those obtained with EMD alone. The potential influence of the chosen graft material or of the surgical procedure (i.e., flap design) on the clinical outcomes is unclear. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The present findings support the use of EMD and bone grafts for the treatment of intrabony periodontal defects.

26006206|t|Effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy on intrahepatic biliary calculi developing after choledochal cyst surgery: A case report.
26006206|a|The development of intra- and extrahepatic bile duct stones has been reported as one of the most serious complications after choledochal cyst excision with biliary-enteric reconstruction through Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ). Here, we report our experience with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in a case of giant intrahepatic stones developing after choledochal cyst surgery. ESWL is an excellent therapeutic modality for large intrahepatic biliary calculi, and after dilating the HJ anastomosis percutaneously, it can be offered as first-line therapy to these patients.

26010249|t|Selective Blockade of Interferon-a and -b Reveals Their Non-Redundant Functions in a Mouse Model of West Nile Virus Infection.
26010249|a|UNASSIGNED: Although type I interferons (IFNs) were first described almost 60 years ago, the ability to monitor and modulate the functional activities of the individual IFN subtypes that comprise this family has been hindered by a lack of reagents. The major type I IFNs, IFN-b and the multiple subtypes of IFN-a, are expressed widely and induce their effects on cells by interacting with a shared heterodimeric receptor (IFNAR). In the mouse, the physiologic actions of IFN-a and IFN-b have been defined using polyclonal anti-type I IFN sera, by targeting IFNAR using monoclonal antibodies or knockout mice, or using Ifnb-/- mice. However, the corresponding analysis of IFN-a has been difficult because of its polygenic nature. Herein, we describe two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that differentially neutralize murine IFN-b or multiple subtypes of murine IFN-a. Using these mAbs, we distinguish specific contributions of IFN-b versus IFN-a in restricting viral pathogenesis and identify IFN-a as the key mediator of the antiviral response in mice infected with West Nile virus. This study thus suggests the utility of these new reagents in dissecting the antiviral and immunomodulatory roles of IFN-b versus IFN-a in murine models of infection, immunity, and autoimmunity.

26096827|t|Activity of synthetic chalcones in hamsters experimentally infected with Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis.
26096827|a|UNASSIGNED: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of synthetic chalcones 1 and 2 in uninfected hamsters and anti-Leishmania activity of synthetic chalcones 1 and 2 in hamsters infected with Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. For the toxicity test, uninfected animals were treated with chalcones 1 and 2, and clinical and biochemical parameters and histological aspects of the liver and kidneys were assessed. Chalcones 1 and 2 were then intraperitoneally or topically administered (10  mg/kg body weight) three times per week in animals infected with promastigotes of L. (V.) braziliensis. We monitored the thickness of the infected footpads, determined parasitic load, performed histological analysis, and detected apoptosis in situ. The results were analyzed using Student's t test and Mann-Whitney test at a significance level of 5  %. Neither of the chalcones showed toxicity. Chalcone 2 administered intraperitoneally significantly reduced the thickness of the infected footpad compared with the beginning of treatment. The parasite load of the lymph node and spleen was reduced in the groups treated with chalcones 1 (topical) and 2 (intraperitoneal). Chalcone 2 (topical) reduced parasite burden only in the lymph node. The histological analysis revealed reconstitution of the tissue and reductions of inflammation and apoptosis in the infected footpad in these groups. The synthetic chalcones 1 (topical) and 2 (intraperitoneal and topical) at a dose of 10  mg/kg showed anti-Leishmania activity in vivo, no renal or hepatic toxicity, and a reduction of apoptosis of the cells in the lesions. These chalcones may have substantial potential for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.

26038684|t|The Teamwork Assessment Scale: A Novel Instrument to Assess Quality of Undergraduate Medical Students' Teamwork Using the Example of Simulation-based Ward-Rounds.
26038684|a|BACKGROUND: Simulation-based teamwork trainings are considered a powerful training method to advance teamwork, which becomes more relevant in medical education. The measurement of teamwork is of high importance and several instruments have been developed for various medical domains to meet this need. To our knowledge, no theoretically-based and easy-to-use measurement instrument has been published nor developed specifically for simulation-based teamwork trainings of medical students. Internist ward-rounds function as an important example of teamwork in medicine. PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to provide a validated, theoretically-based instrument that is easy-to-use. Furthermore, this study aimed to identify if and when rater scores relate to performance. METHODS: Based on a theoretical framework for teamwork behaviour, items regarding four teamwork components (Team Coordination, Team Cooperation, Information Exchange, Team Adjustment Behaviours) were developed. In study one, three ward-round scenarios, simulated by 69 students, were videotaped and rated independently by four trained raters. The instrument was tested for the embedded psychometric properties and factorial structure. In study two, the instrument was tested for construct validity with an external criterion with a second set of 100 students and four raters. RESULTS: In study one, the factorial structure matched the theoretical components but was unable to separate Information Exchange and Team Cooperation. The preliminary version showed adequate psychometric properties (Cronbach's a=.75). In study two, the instrument showed physician rater scores were more reliable in measurement than those of student raters. Furthermore, a close correlation between the scale and clinical performance as an external criteria was shown (r=.64) and the sufficient psychometric properties were replicated (Cronbach's a=.78). CONCLUSIONS: The validation allows for use of the simulated teamwork assessment scale in undergraduate medical ward-round trainings to reliably measure teamwork by physicians. Further studies are needed to verify the applicability of the instrument.

26041745|t|Patients with Slowly Proliferative Early Breast Cancer have Low 5-Year Recurrence Rates in a Phase III Adjuvant Trial of Capecitabine.
26041745|a|PURPOSE: We conducted a randomized phase III study to determine whether patients with early breast cancer would benefit from the addition of capecitabine (X) to a standard regimen of doxorubicin (A) plus cyclophosphamide (C) followed by docetaxel (T). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Treatment comprised 8 cycles of AC/T (T dose: 100 mg/m2 on day 1), or AC/XT (X dose: 825 mg/m2 twice daily, days 1 to 14; T dose: 75 mg/m2 on day 1). The primary endpoint was 5-year disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Of 2,611 women, 1,304 were randomly assigned to receive AC/T and 1,307 to receive AC/XT. After a median follow-up of 5 years, the study failed to meet its primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-1.05; P = 0.125). A significant improvement in overall survival, a secondary endpoint, was seen with AC/XT versus AC/T (HR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51-0.92; P = 0.011). There were no unexpected adverse events. Of patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative disease, 70% of whom were node-positive, 26% and 59% had tumors with a centrally-assessed Ki-67 score of <10% or <20%, respectively, and only 17 (2%) and 53 (6%) DFS events, respectively, occurred in these groups at 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: The very low event rate in patients with ER-positive, low Ki-67 cancers, regardless of nodal status, strongly suggests that these patients should not be enrolled in adjuvant trials that assess 5-year DFS rates, and that central Ki-67 analyses can identify these patients.

26041362|t|Nocturnal Hypertension Correlates Better With Target Organ Damage in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease than a Nondipping Pattern.
26041362|a|UNASSIGNED: Both nocturnal hypertension and nondipping pattern are associated with target organ damages (TODs); however, no data exist with respect to Chinese patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The authors recruited 1322 patients with CKD admitted to our hospital division and referred with data in this cross-sectional study. Patients with nocturnal systolic hypertension had a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and higher left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) compared with patients with normal nocturnal systolic blood pressure (SPB; all, P<.001), while patients in the dipper and nondipper groups had similar levels of eGFR, LVMI, and cIMT when the patients had a similar nocturnal SBP. Factorial-designed analysis of variance indicated that the main effect of nocturnal SBP was significant for all TOD differences (all, P<.001), but no significance existed with respect to the main effect of the dipper pattern and an interaction between the two factors (all, P>.05). Nocturnal systolic hypertension, rather than nondipping pattern, was an independent risk factor for TOD in CKD patients. Nocturnal hypertension, rather than a nondipping pattern, was better associated with TOD in CKD patients.

26020924|t|Trichloroethylene Hypersensitivity Syndrome Is Potentially Mediated through Its Metabolite Chloral Hydrate.
26020924|a|BACKGROUND: We documented previously the entity of trichloroethylene (TCE) hypersensitivity syndrome (THS) in occupational workers. OBJECTIVES: To identify the culprit causative compound, determine the type of hypersensitivity of THS, and establish a screening test for subjects at risk of THS. METHODS: TCE and its main metabolites chloral hydrate (CH), trichloroethanol (TCOH) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) were used as allergens at different concentrations in skin patch tests. The study included 19 case subjects diagnosed with occupational THS, 22 control healthy workers exposed to TCE (exposure >12 weeks), and 20 validation new workers exposed to TCE for <12 weeks free of THS. All subjects were followed-up for 12 weeks after the patch test. RESULTS: The highest patch test positive rate in subjects with THS was for CH, followed by TCOH, TCA and TCE. The CH patch test positive rate was 100% irrespective of CH concentrations (15%, 10% and 5%). The TCOH patch test positive rate was concentration-dependent (89.5%, 73.7% and 52.6% for 5%, 0.5% and 0.05%, respectively). Lower patch test positive rates were noted for TCA and TCE. All patch tests (including four allergens) were all negative in each of the 22 control subjects. None of the subjects of the validation group had a positive 15% CH patch test. CONCLUSIONS: Chloral hydrate seems to be the culprit causative compound of THS and type IV seems to be the major type of hypersensitivity of THS. The CH patch test could be potentially useful for screening workers at risk of THS.

The histological structure of the tumor was presented adenocarcinoma in 57 (95%) patients. Radiation therapy (RT) was carried out in medium or dynamic fractionation. Chemotherapy used pelleted 5-fluorouracil. In group 1 (20 patients) received palliative radiotherapy course with a fractional dose of 3 Gy to 42 Gy SOD (SDeq 51 Gy). In group 2 (20 patients) underwent a course of radiotherapy using dynamic dose fractionation: fractional dose--4, 3 and 2 Gy to 51 Gy SDeq. In the third group (20 patients) underwent combined treatment using dynamic dose fractionation: fractional dose--4, 3 and 2 Gy to 56 Gy SDeq and chemotherapy--Xeloda or ftorafur. In group 1 complete regression was achieved in 1 patient, partial regression--15, stabilization--at 3, progression--at 1, that is clinical effect was observed in 19 of 20 patients. In group 2, complete regression of the tumor was diagnosed in 3 patients, partial regression--17, therefore, 100% of patients had received clinical effect. According to follow-up, 5 patients in this group were subsequently. In the third group of complete regression of the tumor was diagnosed in 7 patients, partial regression--13, ie, 100% of patients had received clinical effect. According to follow-up, 7 patients in this group were subsequently operated. Among the radiation reaction in group 1 nausea 1 tbsp. was observed in 3 patients, radiation Recto 1-2 degree--15, radiation epithelitis 1-2 degree--4 patients; in group 2, nausea 1 degree--At 7, radiation Recto 1-2 degree--At 7, radiation epithelitis 1-2 degree--In 6 patients and 6 reactions were observed; in the third group of nausea 1st. was observed in 7 patients, radiation Recto 1-2 degree--At 9, radiation epithelitis 1-2 degree--At 8 and 3 patients reactions were observed. Thus, when irradiated in the dynamic fractionation showed less pronounced dose response as beam during treatment, and after. Increasing the total dose with the addition radiomodification increases the frequency of complete responses with acceptable toxicity. As a result of treatment in all patients achieved a significant reduction in pain, relief of bleeding.

26075014|t|Diagnostic Accuracy Comparison of Artificial Immune Algorithms for Primary Headaches.
26075014|a|The present study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of immune system algorithms with the aim of classifying the primary types of headache that are not related to any organic etiology. They are divided into four types: migraine, tension, cluster, and other primary headaches. After we took this main objective into consideration, three different neurologists were required to fill in the medical records of 850 patients into our web-based expert system hosted on our project web site. In the evaluation process, Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) were used as the classification algorithms. The AIS are classification algorithms that are inspired by the biological immune system mechanism that involves significant and distinct capabilities. These algorithms simulate the specialties of the immune system such as discrimination, learning, and the memorizing process in order to be used for classification, optimization, or pattern recognition. According to the results, the accuracy level of the classifier used in this study reached a success continuum ranging from 95% to 99%, except for the inconvenient one that yielded 71% accuracy.

26056770|a|UNASSIGNED: Recent studies based on metagenomics and other molecular techniques have permitted a detailed knowledge of the microbial diversity and metabolic activities of microorganisms in hypersaline environments. The current accepted model of community structure in hypersaline environments is that the square archaeon Haloquadratum waslbyi, the bacteroidete Salinibacter ruber and nanohaloarchaea are predominant members at higher salt concentrations, while more diverse archaeal and bacterial taxa are observed in habitats with intermediate salinities. Additionally, metagenomic studies may provide insight into the isolation and characterization of the principal microbes in these habitats, such as the recently described gammaproteobacterium Spiribacter salinus.

26049025|t|Emergence of sex differences in the development of substance use and abuse during adolescence.
26049025|a|UNASSIGNED: Substance use and abuse begin during adolescence. Male and female adolescent humans initiate use at comparable rates, but males increase use faster. In adulthood, more men than women use and abuse addictive drugs. However, some women progress more rapidly from initiation of use to entry into treatment. In animal models, adolescent males and females consume addictive drugs similarly. However, reproductively mature females acquire self-administration faster, and in some models, escalate use more. Sex/gender differences exist in neurobiologic factors mediating both reinforcement (dopamine, opioids) and aversiveness (CRF, dynorphin), as well as intrinsic factors (personality, psychiatric co-morbidities) and extrinsic factors (history of abuse, environment especially peers and family) which influence the progression from initial use to abuse. Many of these important differences emerge during adolescence, and are moderated by sexual differentiation of the brain. Estradiol effects which enhance both dopaminergic and CRF-mediated processes contribute to the female vulnerability to substance use and abuse. Testosterone enhances impulsivity and sensation seeking in both males and females. Several protective factors in females also influence initiation and progression of substance use including hormonal changes of pregnancy as well as greater capacity for self-regulation and lower peak levels of impulsivity/sensation seeking. Same sex peers represent a risk factor more for males than females during adolescence, while romantic partners increase risk for women during this developmental epoch. In summary, biologic factors, psychiatric co-morbidities as well as personality and environment present sex/gender-specific risks as adolescents begin to initiate substance use.

26047245|t|Generation and Detection of Spin Currents in Semiconductor Nanostructures with Strong Spin-Orbit Interaction.
26047245|a|UNASSIGNED: Storing, transmitting, and manipulating information using the electron spin resides at the heart of spintronics. Fundamental for future spintronics applications is the ability to control spin currents in solid state systems. Among the different platforms proposed so far, semiconductors with strong spin-orbit interaction are especially attractive as they promise fast and scalable spin control with all-electrical protocols. Here we demonstrate both the generation and measurement of pure spin currents in semiconductor nanostructures. Generation is purely electrical and mediated by the spin dynamics in materials with a strong spin-orbit field. Measurement is accomplished using a spin-to-charge conversion technique, based on the magnetic field symmetry of easily measurable electrical quantities. Calibrating the spin-to-charge conversion via the conductance of a quantum point contact, we quantitatively measure the mesoscopic spin Hall effect in a multiterminal GaAs dot. We report spin currents of 174  pA, corresponding to a spin Hall angle of 34%.

26011098|t|Non-Close-Packed Breath Figures via Ion-Partitioning-Mediated Self-Assembly.
26011098|a|UNASSIGNED: We report a one-step method of forming non-close-packed (NCP) pore arrays of micro- and sub-micropores using chloroform-based solutions of polystyrene acidified with hydrogen bromide for breath figure (BF) patterning. As BF patterning takes place, water vapor condenses onto the polystyrene solution, forming water droplets on the solution surface. Concurrently, preferential ion partitioning of hydrogen bromide leads to positively charged water droplets, which experience interdroplet electrostatic repulsion. Self-organization of charged water droplets because of surface flow and subsequent evaporation of the droplet templates result in ordered BF arrays with pore separation/diameter (L/D) ratios of up to 16.5. Evidence from surface potential scans show proof for preferential ion partitioning of HBr. Radial distribution functions and Voronoi polygon analysis of pore arrays show that they possess a high degree of conformational order. Past fabrication methods of NCP structures typically require multi-step processes. In contrast, we have established a new route for facile self-assembly of previously inaccessible patterns, which comprises of only a single operational step.

26001558|t|Antibacterial activity of native California medicinal plant extracts isolated from Rhamnus californica and Umbellularia californica.
26001558|a|BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global public health. Medicinal plants have long been used as remedies for infectious diseases by native cultures around the world and have the potential for providing effective treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections. Rhamnus californica (Rhamnaceae) and Umbellularia californica (Lauraceae) are two indigenous California plant species historically used by Native Americans to treat skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. This study aimed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of R. and U. californica against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: Methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of R. and U. californica were prepared by soxhlet extraction and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. Chemical profiling of the extracts was performed using standard methods. RESULTS: All extracts inhibited the growth of MRSA and other Gram-positive bacteria with MICs of 3.3-6.0  mg/ml. Gram-negative organisms were unaffected by these extracts. U. californica extracts (leaves and bark) had the lowest MIC values. Chemical profiling detected the presence of quinones, alkaloids, flavonoids, cardenolides, tannins and saponins in these extracts. Our study is the first to report the antimicrobial properties of R. and U. californica and illustrates their promising anti-MRSA potential. CONCLUSIONS: Our results give scientific credence to the traditional medicinal uses of these plants by the indigenous peoples of California. Further investigation of the secondary metabolites responsible for the antimicrobial activity of these extracts against MRSA is warranted.

26002561|t|Neocaridina denticulata: A Decapod Crustacean Model for Functional Genomics.
26002561|a|UNASSIGNED: A decapod crustacean model is needed for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying physiological processes, such as reproduction, sex determination, molting and growth, immunity, regeneration, and response to stress. Criteria for selection are: life-history traits, adult size, availability and ease of culture, and genomics and genetic manipulation. Three freshwater species are considered: cherry shrimp, Neocaridina denticulata; red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii; and redclaw crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus. All three are readily available, reproduce year round, and grow rapidly. The crayfish species require more space for culture than does N. denticulata. The transparent cuticle of cherry shrimp provides for direct assessment of reproductive status, stage of molt, and tissue-specific expression of reporter genes, and facilitates screening of mutations affecting phenotype. Moreover, a preliminary genome of N. denticulata is available and efforts toward complete genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing have been initiated. Neocaridina denticulata possesses the best combination of traits that make it most suitable as a model for functional genomics. The next step is to obtain the complete genome sequence and to develop molecular technologies for the screening of mutants and for manipulating tissue-specific gene expression.

26073839|t|[Auto-immune encephalitis in psychiatric practice].
26073839|a|BACKGROUND: Our knowledge about auto-immune limbic encephalitis is increasing rapidly and it is now evident that patients with this disease can present with psychiatric symptoms. AIM: To propose practical guidelines for the recognition and diagnosis of an underlying auto-immune limbic encephalitis in patients with acute psychiatric symptoms. METHOD: We studied recent reviews on the topic and had discussions with psychiatrists, a neurologist and a neuroimmunologist in order to reach consensus. RESULTS: Auto-immune limbic encephalitis is a rather rare but important diagnostic consideration in patients with acute psychiatric symptoms. We describe the different steps in the diagnostic work-up and mention features that can point to an underlying auto-immune encephalitis. These include atypical psychiatric symptoms, seizures, movement disorders and autonomic instability. CONCLUSION: Since patients with autoimmune limbic encephalitis often present with psychiatric symptoms, curative treatment is often available and the prognosis depends on the delay from presentation to treatment, psychiatrists should be aware of the signs of an underlying autoimmune encephalitis which have been described in this article.

26073914|t|Elevation of NO production increases Fe immobilization in the Fe-deficiency roots apoplast by decreasing pectin methylation of cell wall.
26073914|a|Cell wall is the major component of root apoplast which is the main reservoir for iron in roots, while nitric oxide (NO) is involved in regulating the synthesis of cell wall. However, whether such regulation could influence the reutilization of iron stored in root apoplast remains unclear. In this study, we observed that iron deficiency elevated NO level in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) roots. However, application of S-nitrosoglutathione, a NO donor, significantly enhanced iron retention in root apoplast of iron-deficient plants, accompanied with a decrease of iron level in xylem sap. Consequently, S-nitrosoglutathione treatment increased iron concentration in roots, but decreased it in shoots. The opposite was true for the NO scavenging treatment with 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO). Interestingly, S-nitrosoglutathione treatment increased pectin methylesterase activity and decreased degree of pectin methylation in root cell wall of both iron-deficient and iron-sufficient plants, which led to an increased iron retention in pectin fraction, thus increasing the binding capacity of iron to the extracted cell wall. Altogether, these results suggested that iron-deficiency-induced elevation of NO increases iron immobilization in root apoplast by decreasing pectin methylation in cell wall.

26020645|t|UniqTag: Content-Derived Unique and Stable Identifiers for Gene Annotation.
26020645|a|UNASSIGNED: When working on an ongoing genome sequencing and assembly project, it is rather inconvenient when gene identifiers change from one build of the assembly to the next. The gene labelling system described here, UniqTag, addresses this common challenge. UniqTag assigns a unique identifier to each gene that is a representative k-mer, a string of length k, selected from the sequence of that gene. Unlike serial numbers, these identifiers are stable between different assemblies and annotations of the same data without requiring that previous annotations be lifted over by sequence alignment. We assign UniqTag identifiers to ten builds of the Ensembl human genome spanning eight years to demonstrate this stability. The implementation of UniqTag in Ruby and an R package are available at https://github.com/sjackman/uniqtag sjackman/uniqtag. The R package is also available from CRAN: install.packages ("uniqtag"). Supplementary material and code to reproduce it is available at https://github.com/sjackman/uniqtag-paper.

26017749|t|Association between statin use and plasma D-dimer levels. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.
26017749|a|UNASSIGNED: D-dimers, specific breakdown fragments of cross-linked fibrin, are generally used as circulating markers of activated coagulation. Statins influence haemostatic factors, but their effect on plasma D-dimer levels is controversial. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between statin therapy and plasma D-dimer levels. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus and EMBASE (up to September 25, 2014) to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the impact of statin therapy on plasma D-dimer levels. Two independent reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, methods and outcomes. Meta-analysis of data from nine RCTs with 1,165 participants showed a significant effect of statin therapy in reducing plasma D-dimer levels (standardised mean difference [SMD]: -0.988   g/ml, 95   % confidence interval [CI]: -1.590 - -0.385, p=0.001). The effect size was robust in sensitivity analysis and omission of no single study significantly changed the overall estimated effect size. In the subgroup analysis, the effect of statins on plasma D-dimer levels was significant only in the subsets of studies with treatment duration >=    12 weeks (SMD: -0.761   g/ml, 95   %CI: -1.163- -0.360; p<   0.001), and for lipophilic statins (atorvastatin and simvastatin) (SMD: -1.364   g/ml, 95   % CI: -2.202- -0.526; p=0.001). Hydrophilic statins (pravastatin and rosuvastatin) did not significantly reduce plasma D-dimer levels (SMD: -0.237   g/ml, 95   %CI: -1.140-0.665, p=0.606). This meta-analysis of RCTs suggests a decrease of plasma D-dimer levels after three months of statin therapy, and especially after treatment with lipophilic statins. Well-designed trials are required to validate these results.

26026109|t|Retrospective Analysis of Concurrent Chemoradiation with Triweekly Cisplatin plus 5-Fluorouracil Versus Weekly Cisplatin in Cervical Cancer.
26026109|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: Concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) is the standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer. The purpose of the study was to compare the outcomes of triweekly cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil and weekly cisplatin regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 91 patients with stage IB1-IVA cervical cancer. RESULTS: Out of 91 patients, 48 received triweekly CCRT and 43 received weekly CCRT. For triweekly CCRT, patients received a median of two chemotherapy cycles and median total doses of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil were 210 mg/body and 8,525 mg/body, respectively. For weekly CCRT, patients received a median of five chemotherapy cycles and the median total dose of cisplatin was 252 mg/body. No statistically significant differences in overall survival or progression-free survival were noted between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Both triweekly CCRT and weekly CCRT appear to have similar efficacy for cervical cancer patients, but the toxicities were better tolerable in weekly CCRT.

26022877|t|Gastrointestinal food allergies.
26022877|a|Gastrointestinal food allergies present during early childhood with a diverse range of symptoms. Cow's milk, soy and wheat are the three most common gastrointestinal food allergens. Several clinical syndromes have been described, including food protein-induced enteropathy, proctocolitis and enterocolitis. In contrast with immediate, IgE-mediated food allergies, the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms is delayed for at least 1-2 hours after ingestion in non-IgE-mediated allergic disorders. The pathophysiology of these non-IgE-mediated allergic disorders is poorly understood, and useful in vitro markers are lacking. The results of the skin prick test or measurement of the food-specific serum IgE level is generally negative, although low-positive results may occur. Diagnosis therefore relies on the recognition of a particular clinical phenotype as well as the demonstration of clear clinical improvement after food allergen elimination and the re-emergence of symptoms upon challenge. There is a significant clinical overlap between non-IgE-mediated food allergy and several common paediatric gastroenterological conditions, which may lead to diagnostic confusion. The treatment of gastrointestinal food allergies requires the strict elimination of offending food allergens until tolerance has developed. In breast-fed infants, a maternal elimination diet is often sufficient to control symptoms. In formula-fed infants, treatment usually involves the use an extensively hydrolysed or amino acid-based formula. Apart from the use of hypoallergenic formulae, the solid diets of these children also need to be kept free of specific food allergens, as clinically indicated. The nutritional progress of infants and young children should be carefully monitored, and they should undergo ongoing, regular food protein elimination reassessments by cautious food challenges to monitor for possible tolerance development.    2015 S.

26022092|t|Tests of conspecificity for allopatric vectors: Simulium nodosum and Simulium shirakii (Diptera: Simuliidae) in Asia.
26022092|a|BACKGROUND: Allopatric populations present challenges for biologists working with vectors. We suggest that conspecificity can be concluded in these cases when data from four character sets-chromosomal, ecological, molecular, and morphological-express variation no greater between the allopatric populations than between corresponding sympatric populations. We use this approach to test the conspecificity of Simulium nodosum Puri on the mainland of Southeast Asia and Simulium shirakii Kono _ Takahasi in Taiwan. The validity of these two putative species has long been disputed given that they are morphologically indistinguishable. FINDINGS: The mitochondria-encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), 12S rRNA, and 16S rRNA genes and the nuclear-encoded 28S rRNA gene support the conspecific status of S. nodosum from Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam and S. shirakii from Taiwan; 0 to 0.19  % genetic differences between the two taxa suggest intraspecific polymorphism. The banding patterns of the polytene chromosomes of the insular Taiwanese population of S. shirakii and mainland populations of S. nodosum are congruent. The overlapping ranges of habitat characteristics and hosts of S. nodosum and S. shirakii corroborate the chromosomal, molecular, and morphological data. CONCLUSIONS: Four independent sources of evidence (chromosomes, DNA, ecology, and morphology) support the conspecificity of S. nodosum and S. shirakii. We, therefore, synonymize S. shirakii with S. nodosum. This study provides a guide for applying the procedure of testing conspecificity to other sets of allopatric vectors.

26021737|t|Fatigue Is Associated with Increased Risk of Mortality in Patients on Chronic Hemodialysis.
26021737|a|BACKGROUND: Little is known about the correlation between fatigue and survival in patients on chronic hemodialysis and whether fatigue is an independent predictor of outcome above and beyond the effects of depression. The aim of the present study was to determine if fatigue is a predictor of mortality in patients on chronic hemodialysis (CHP) and if this occurs independently of the symptoms of depression. METHODS: CHP referring to the Hemodialysis Service of the Universit   Cattolica of Rome, Italy between November 2007 and January 2015 were studied. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded for each patient at the moment of the inclusion in the study. Fatigue levels were assessed in patients using the Vitality Scale of SF-36 (SF-36 VS), functional ability by the activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), depressive symptoms through the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), cognitive function using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and comorbidity through the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Patients were grouped into four groups (quartiles): Quartile 1 (Q1), >65; Q2, >= 50 to <65; Q3, >= 35 to <50; Q4, <35. RESULTS: We studied 126 patients: 11 were transplanted and 53 died. Patients who later died were older and had a worse cognitive performance, higher CCI and GDS scores, lower ADL, IADL and SF-36 VS scores, lower serum creatinine and albumin levels. Kaplan-Meier survival was significantly lower in Q4 than in Q1 (p = 0.0001). According to Cox regression analysis, higher fatigue (Q4) was associated with a higher risk of mortality (HR, 95% CI: 5.29, 2.2-12.73). CONCLUSION: Fatigue is associated with an increased risk of mortality in CHP, with the relationship independent of symptoms of depression. Fatigue should be assessed routinely and may be a potential target of interventions that aim to reduce mortality in CHP.    2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

26024138|t|The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Tylototriton taliangensis (Amphibia: Caudata).
26024138|a|UNASSIGNED: Tylototriton taliangensis was listed as a Near Threatened amphibian in IUCN red list. In this study, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial (mt) genome of this species (GenBank: KP979646) and found it contains 16,265 base pairs, which encode 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNA), 2 ribosomal RNA genes (rRNA) and 1 control region (CR). We also found that almost all PCGs and tRNA genes are located on the H-strand, except for ND6 subunit gene and eight tRNA genes, which were distributed on the L-strand. The PCGs used "ATG" and "GTG" as the start codon, while used four types of stop codons. Almost all tRNA genes were folded into typical cloverleaf secondary structures. The L-strand replication origin (OL) and a non-coding region were also found. The new mitogenomic phylogenetic tree confirms the reciprocally monophyly of the genus Tylototriton, Echinotriton and Pleurodeles with high bootstrap value. The present study will provide information for future studies on the conservation genetics and phylogeny of this species and its relatives.

26029910|t|Molecular Characteristics of Extended-Spectrum Cephalosporin-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae from Humans in the Community.
26029910|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)-resistant Enterobacteriaceae collected during a cross-sectional study examining the prevalence and risk factors for faecal carriage of extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in humans living in areas with high or low broiler density. METHODS: ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were identified by combination disc-diffusion test. ESBL/AmpC/carbapenemase genes were analysed using PCR and sequencing. For E. coli, phylogenetic groups and MLST were determined. Plasmids were characterized by transformation and PCR-based replicon typing. Subtyping of plasmids was done by plasmid multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: 175 ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were cultured from 165/1,033 individuals. The isolates were Escherichia coli(n=65), Citrobacter freundii (n=52), Enterobacter cloacae (n=38), Morganella morganii (n=5), Enterobacter aerogenes (n=4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=3), Hafnia alvei (n=2), Shigella spp. (n=2), Citrobacter amalonaticus (n=1), Escherichia hermannii (n=1), Kluyvera cryocrescens (n=1), and Pantoea agglomerans (n=1). The following ESBL genes were recovered in 55 isolates originating from 49 of 1,033 (4.7 %) persons: blaCTX-M-1 (n=17), blaCTX-M-15 (n=16), blaCTX-M-14 (n=9), blaCTX-M-2 (n=3), blaCTX-M-3 (n=2), blaCTX-M-24 (n=2), blaCTX-M-27 (n=1), blaCTX-M-32 (n=1), blaSHV-12 (n=2), blaSHV-65 (n=1) and blaTEM-52 (n=1). Plasmidic AmpC (pAmpC) genes were discovered in 6 out of 1,033 (0.6 %) persons. One person carried two different E. coli isolates, one with blaCTX-M-1 and the other with blaCMY-2 and therefore the prevalence of persons carrying Enterobacteriaceae harboring ESBL and/or pAmpC genes was 5.2 %. In eight E. coli isolates the AmpC phenotype was caused by mutations in the AmpC promoter region. No carbapenemase genes were identified. A large variety of E. coli genotypes was found, ST131 and ST10 being most common. CONCLUSIONS: ESBL/pAmpC genes resembled those from patients in Dutch hospitals, indicating that healthy humans form a reservoir for transmission of these determinants to vulnerable people. The role of poultry in the transmission to humans in the community remains to be elucidated.

26026650|t|Activating schoolyards: study design of a quasi-experimental schoolyard intervention study.
26026650|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of the Activating Schoolyards Study is to develop, implement, document and assess a comprehensive schoolyard intervention to promote physical activity (PA) during school recess for primary school children (grade 4-8). The intervention is designed to implement organizational and structural changes in the physical environment. METHOD: The study builds on a quasi-experimental study design using a mixed method approach including: 1) an exploratory study aimed at providing input for the developing process; 2) an evaluation of the effect of the interventions using a combination of accelerometer, GPS and GIS; 3) a process evaluation facilitating the intervention development process and identifying barriers and facilitators in the implementation process; 4) a post-intervention end-user evaluation aimed at exploring who uses the schoolyards and how the schoolyards are used. The seven project schools (cases) were selected by means of an open competition and the interventions were developed using a participatory bottom-up approach. DISCUSSION: The participatory approach and case selection strategy make the study design novel. The use of a mixed methods design including qualitative as well as quantitative methods can be seen as a strength, as the different types of data complement each other and results of one part of the study informed the following parts. A unique aspect of our study is the use of accelerometers in combination with GPS and GIS in the effect evaluation to objectively determine where and how active the students are in the schoolyard, before and after the intervention. This provides a type of data that, to our knowledge, has not been used before in schoolyard interventions. Exploring the change in behavior in relation to specific intervention elements in the schoolyard will lead to recommendations for schools undergoing schoolyard renovations at some point in the future.

26009149|t|Opening up animal research and science-society relations? A thematic analysis of transparency discourses in the United Kingdom.
26009149|a|UNASSIGNED: The use of animals in scientific research represents an interesting case to consider in the context of the contemporary preoccupation with transparency and openness in science and governance. In the United Kingdom, organisations critical of animal research have long called for more openness. More recently, organisations involved in animal research also seem to be embracing transparency discourses. This article provides a detailed analysis of publically available documents from animal protection groups, the animal research community and government/research funders. Our aim is to explore the similarities and differences in the way transparency is constructed and to identify what more openness is expected to achieve. In contrast to the existing literature, we conclude that the slipperiness of transparency discourses may ultimately have transformative implications for the relationship between science and society and that contemporary openness initiatives might be sowing the seeds for change to the status quo.

26024723|t|Acceptance Probability (P a) Analysis for Process Validation Lifecycle Stages.
26024723|a|UNASSIGNED: This paper introduces an innovative statistical approach towards understanding how variation impacts the acceptance criteria of quality attributes. Because of more complex stage-wise acceptance criteria, traditional process capability measures are inadequate for general application in the pharmaceutical industry. The probability of acceptance concept provides a clear measure, derived from specific acceptance criteria for each quality attribute. In line with the 2011 FDA Guidance, this approach systematically evaluates data and scientifically establishes evidence that a process is capable of consistently delivering quality product. The probability of acceptance provides a direct and readily understandable indication of product risk. As with traditional capability indices, the acceptance probability approach assumes that underlying data distributions are normal. The computational solutions for dosage uniformity and dissolution acceptance criteria are readily applicable. For dosage uniformity, the expected AV range may be determined using the s lo and s hi values along with the worst case estimates of the mean. This approach permits a risk-based assessment of future batch performance of the critical quality attributes. The concept is also readily applicable to sterile/non sterile liquid dose products. Quality attributes such as deliverable volume and assay per spray have stage-wise acceptance that can be converted into an acceptance probability. Accepted statistical guidelines indicate processes with C pk   >   1.33 as performing well within statistical control and those with C pk   <   1.0 as "incapable" (1). A C pk   >   1.33 is associated with a centered process that will statistically produce less than 63 defective units per million. This is equivalent to an acceptance probability of >99.99%.

26019719|t|Social and psychological factors of the suicidal tendencies of Chinese medical students.
26019719|a|BACKGROUND: Over the past few decades, concern about suicide by college students has been on the rise worldwide, in general and in China particularly. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effects of social and psychological factors on the suicidal tendencies of Chinese medical students. FINDINGS: Of the 540 students surveyed, 48 had a suicidal tendency to some extent. The highest rate of suicide was observed for fourth-year students, followed by the fifth-year, first-year, third-year, and second-year students. Female students and students not satisfied with their major had a higher rate of suicidal tendency. However, mature coping strategies had a protective effect on suicide. The stepwise regression analysis shows that academic burden, grade, and introversion/extraversion are the most significant risk factors for the suicidal tendency of Chinese medical students. CONCLUSION: Suicide is affected by demographic risk factors as well as psychological factors. Our results lend support to a multi-factorial approach to the understanding and prevention of suicide by college students.

26028651|t|Systematic Review on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Among Survivors of the Wenchuan Earthquake.
26028651|a|UNASSIGNED: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) widely occurs among victims or witness of disasters. With flashbacks, hyperarousal, and avoidance being the typical symptoms, PTSD became a focus of psychological research. The earthquake in Wenchuan, China, on May 12, 2008, was without precedent in magnitude and aftermath and caused huge damage, which drew scientists' attention to mental health of the survivors. We conducted a systematic overview by collecting published articles from the PubMed database and classifying them into five points: epidemiology, neuropathology, biochemistry, genetics and epigenetics, and treatment. The large body of research during the past 6 years showed that adolescents and adults were among the most studied populations with high prevalence rates for PTSD. Genomic and transcriptomic studies focusing on gene * environment studies as well as epigenetics are still rare, although a few available data showed great potential to better understand the pathophysiology of PTSD as multifactorial disease. Phytotherapy with Chinese herbs and acupuncture are rarely reported as of yet, although the first published data indicated promising therapy effects. Future studies should focus on the following points: (1) The affected populations under observation should be better defined concerning individual risk factor, time of observation, spatial movement, and individual disease courses of patients. (2) The role of social support for prevalence rates of PTSD should be observed in more detail. (3) Efficacy and safety of Chinese medicine should be studied to find potential interventions and effective treatments of PTSD.

26023249|t|Segmentation of microcystic macular edema in Cirrus OCT scans with an exploratory longitudinal study.
26023249|a|UNASSIGNED: Microcystic macular edema (MME) is a term used to describe pseudocystic spaces in the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the human retina. It has been noted in multiple sclerosis (MS) as well as a variety of other diseases. The processes that lead to MME formation and their change over time have yet to be explained sufficiently. The low rate at which MME occurs within such diverse patient groups makes the identification and consistent quantification of this pathology important for developing patient-specific prognoses. MME is observed in optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina as changes in light reflectivity in a pattern suggestive of fluid accumulations called pseudocysts. Pseudocysts can be readily identified in higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) images, however pseudocysts can be indistinguishable from noise in lower SNR scans. In this work, we expand upon our earlier MME identification methods on Spectralis OCT scans to handle lower quality Cirrus OCT scans. Our approach uses a random forest classifier, trained on manual segmentation of ten subjects, to automatically detect MME. The algorithm has a true positive rate for MME identification of 0.95 and a Dice score of 0.79. We include a preliminary longitudinal study of three patients over four to five years to explore the longitudinal changes of MME. The patients with relapsing-remitting MS and neuromyelitis optica appear to have dynamic pseudocyst volumes, while the MME volume appears stable in the one patient with primary progressive MS.

26038923|t|Effects of Chlorella sp. on nutrient treatment in cultures with different carbon to nitrogen ratios.
26038923|a|UNASSIGNED: Chlorella sp. is often used in the treatment of wastewater to produce lipids, a practice which could go beyond wastewater treatment and be used to generate green energy. Our objectives here are to explore how the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N) affects the removal of carbon and nitrogen in a wastewater treatment system, while simultaneously generating biomass and lipids. In this study, the C/N ratio is adjusted to 0.002, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 32. The results indicate that a C/N of 10 is sufficient to ensure the consumption of carbon and nitrogen, achieving the lowest concentration in the shortest culturing time (32 h). When nitrogen is lacking in the culture, there will be a slight decrease in the rate of carbon consumption which leads to a limitation of nitrogen and an increase in the lipid/cell density even at 96 h of culture time. The highest lipid content (0.57 g/L) and lipid increase rate (0.4 g/L) occurs with a C/N of 32. The greatest amount of biomass, 1.42 g/L is achieved when the C/N is 32. The carbon concentration is the main factor affecting the nitrogen consumption and the increase in the biomass and lipid content.

26032446|t|Severe pain during local infiltration for spinal anaesthesia predicts post-caesarean pain.
26032446|a|BACKGROUND: Quantitative sensory testing (QST) measures response to painful stimuli and has been used to predict post-caesarean pain. Pain reported upon intravenous cannulation was shown to predict epidural analgesic use and pain intensity during labour. We hypothesized that pain intensity reported by women upon local anaesthesia injection (ILA) for spinal anaesthesia may predict acute pain after caesarean delivery (CD). METHODS: In a prospective observational trial, 229 women undergoing elective CD under spinal anaesthesia were enrolled. Using standardized script before ILA, women received ILA (lidocaine 1% 2.5  mL via 25 G needle), and provided an ILA score after the injection [verbal numeric pain scale (VNPS); 0-100]. Demographic data, average, peak pain (at rest, with movement and uterine cramping) and analgesic requests were recorded for the first 24  h. RESULTS: Fourteen percent of women experienced severe pain (VNPS >= 70) upon ILA. Good correlation was noted between ILA and pain scores at rest and upon mobilization during the 24  h following surgery (average resting pain r  =  0.529, p  <  0.001, average pain at mobilization r  =  0.483, p  <  0.0001). Severe acute postoperative pain (VNPS >= 70) was predicted by severe ILA pain with a sensitivity of 91.6% and specificity of 93.3%. CONCLUSION: This is the first study evaluating a clinical measure to predict post-caesarean pain. Our main findings were that 14% of women experience severe pain upon ILA, which was associated with increased pain during the first 24  h.

26036454|t|DHEAS and cortisol/DHEAS-ratio in recurrent depression: State, or trait predicting 10-year recurrence?
26036454|a|BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with low dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEAS), - particularly relative to high cortisol - although conflicting findings exist. Moreover, it is unclear whether low DHEAS is only present during the depressive state, or manifests as a trait that may reflect vulnerability for recurrence. Therefore, we longitudinally tested whether low DHEAS and high cortisol/DHEAS-ratio in recurrent MDD (I) reflects a trait, and/or (II) varies with depressive state. In addition, we tested associations with (III) previous MDD-episodes, (IV) prospective recurrence, and (V) effects of cognitive therapy. METHODS: At study-entry, we cross-sectionally compared morning and evening salivary DHEAS and molar cortisol/DHEAS-ratio of 187 remitted recurrent MDD-patients with 72 matched controls. Subsequently, patients participated in an 8-week randomized controlled cognitive therapy trial. We repeated salivary measures after 3 months and 2 years. We measured clinical symptoms during a 10-year follow-up. RESULTS: Remitted patients showed steeper diurnal DHEAS-decline (p<.005) and a flatter diurnal profile of cortisol/DHEAS-ratio (p<.001) than controls. We found no state-effect in DHEAS or cortisol/DHEAS-ratio throughout follow-up and no association with number of previous episodes. Higher morning cortisol/DHEAS-ratio predicted shorter time till recurrence over the 10-year follow-up in interaction with the effects of cognitive therapy (p<.05). Finally, cognitive therapy did not influence DHEAS or cortisol/DHEAS-ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Diurnal profiles of DHEAS and cortisol/DHEAS-ratio remain equally altered in between depressive episodes, and may predict future recurrence. This suggests they represent an endophenotypic vulnerability trait rather than a state-effect, which provides a new road to understand recurrent depression and its prevention.

Widespread acceptance of pre-approval tests of confusability is compromised by the lack of experimental designs and statistical methods to support valid inferences about whether a proposed new name is unacceptably confusing. One way of identifying confusing names is to conduct memory and perception experiments on a set of drug names which would include both the new name and a set of control names (e.g., names already on the market). The experiment would yield an observed error rate for every name. Inferences about the acceptability of the new name can be made by comparing the error rate of the new name to the distribution of error rates of the control names. We describe four memory and perception experiments on drug names, carried out using clinicians as participants. Each experiment included drug names designated as test and control names. We demonstrate how to use a combination of logistic regression, Poisson prediction limits, and highly assured credible intervals to identify and apply a threshold for identifying unacceptably confusing names. Our models show an excellent fit to the data. These experimental designs and analytic methods should be useful in the pre-approval testing of proposed new drug names and in similar regulatory scenarios where it is necessary to draw inferences about the comparative safety or effectiveness of new versus old products.

26034823|t|Loss and Loneliness: Audrey's Story.
26034823|a|Loneliness is a concept recently capturing the attention of nursing and other healthcare professionals due to its unfavorable effects on health outcomes. The purpose of this article is to convey the story of one widow named Audrey (pseudonym) and to describe her experiences of profound loneliness. Narratives from this single case study are reported as part of a larger qualitative, phenomenological study on loneliness in community-dwelling older adults. Findings from Audrey's story reveal intense periods of loneliness, longing and loss primarily resulting from the death of her spouse. Excerpts from these narratives uncover Audrey's coping strategies for loneliness, which included watching television, telephoning her children, reading the paper, and finding comfort in her faith. Audrey's story is essential for all home healthcare professionals to understand, as it illustrates the powerful impact of loneliness on the quality of life and health of an older adult.

26030882|t|Derivatization of (quinolin-8-yl)phosphinimidic amides via ortho-lithiation revisited.
26030882|a|UNASSIGNED: The direct ortho-lithiation of N-H containing (quinolin-8-yl)phosphinimidic amides by reaction with 1 equiv. of n-BuLi described by Wang and co-workers has been re-examined. The multinuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H, (2)H, (7)Li, (13)C, (15)N and (31)P) study of the species formed in the monolithiation of N-(tert-butyl)-P,P-diphenyl-N'-(quinolin-8-yl)phosphinimidic amide with n-BuLi in THF showed that proton abstraction occurred exclusively and quantitatively at the NH. The combination of the NMR results with a DFT study made it possible to describe the structure of the N-lithiated species as a dimer consisting of an eight-membered ring showing two lithium ions triply coordinated to nitrogen atoms corresponding to the deprotonated amine and aminoquinoline moieties of different monomers. The formation of a polymer featuring the same coordination mode couldn't be excluded. In addition, optimized conditions for the efficient derivatization of via ortho-lithiation were realised. The reaction of with 2.4 equiv. of t-BuLi in THF in the temperature range of -80   C to 25   C for 3 h afforded a N,Cortho-dilithiated species that was trapped with a series of electrophiles leading to new functionalized ortho derivatives of in good yields.

26080549|a|Curcumin-ethyl-cellulose (EC) sustained-release composite particles were prepared by using supercritical CO2 anti-solvent technology. With drug loading and yield of inclusion complex as evaluation indexes, on the basis of single factor tests, orthogonal experimental design was used to optimize the preparation process of curcumin-EC sustained-release composite particles. The experiments such as drug loading, yield, particle size distribution, electron microscope analysis (SEM) , infrared spectrum (IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and in vitro dissolution were used to analyze the optimal process combination. The orthogonal experimental optimization process conditions were set as follows: crystallization temperature 45 degrees C, crystallization pressure 10 MPa, curcumin concentration 8 g x L(-1), solvent flow rate 0.9 mL x min(-1), and CO2 velocity 4 L x min(-1). Under the optimal conditions, the average drug loading and yield of curcumin-EC sustained-release composite particles were 33.01% and 83.97%, and the average particle size of the particles was 20.632  m. IR and DSC analysis showed that curcumin might complex with EC. The experiments of in vitro dissolution showed that curcumin-EC composite particles had good sustained-release effect. Curcumin-EC sustained-release composite particles can be prepared by supercritical CO2 anti-solvent technology.

26083568|t|Cerebrospinal Fluid Particles in Alzheimer Disease and Parkinson Disease.
26083568|a|UNASSIGNED: Human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contains diverse lipid particles, including lipoproteins that are distinct from their plasma counterparts and contain apolipoprotein (apo) E isoforms, apoJ, and apoAI, and extracellular vesicles, which can be detected by annexin V binding. The aim of this study was to develop a method to quantify CSF particles and evaluate their relationship to aging and neurodegenerative diseases. We used a flow cytometric assay to detect annexin V-, apoE-, apoAI-, apoJ-, and amyloid (A) b42-positive particles in CSF from 131 research volunteers who were neurologically normal or had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia, or Parkinson disease. APOE   4/  4 participants had CSF apoE-positive particles that were more frequently larger but at an 88% lower level versus those in APOE   3/  3 or APOE   3/  4 patients; this finding was reproduced in conditioned medium from mouse primary glial cell cultures with targeted replacement of apoE. Cerebrospinal fluid apoE-positive and b-amyloid (Ab42)-positive particle concentrations were persistently reduced one-third to one-half in middle and older age subjects; apoAI-positive particle concentration progressively increased approximately 2-fold with age. Both apoAI-positive and annexin V-positive CSF particle levels were reduced one-third to one-half in CSF of MCI and/or AD dementia patients versus age-matched controls. Our approach provides new methods to investigate CNS lipid biology in relation to neurodegeneration and perhaps develop new biomarkers for diagnosis or treatment monitoring.

26114502|t|Treatment of Chronic Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis with Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate and Glatiramer Acetate Alters Expression of Heme-Oxygenase-1.
26114502|a|UNASSIGNED: We previously demonstrated that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) synergizes with the immunomodulatory agent glatiramer acetate (GA) in eliciting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in the relapsing-remitting EAE model. Thus, we hypothesized that mice with chronic EAE may also benefit from this combination therapy. We first assessed how a treatment with a single dose of GA together with daily application of EGCG may modulate EAE. Although single therapies with a suboptimal dose of GA or EGCG led to disease amelioration and reduced CNS inflammation, the combination therapy had no effects. While EGCG appeared to preserve axons and myelin, the single GA dose did not improve axonal damage or demyelination. Interestingly, the neuroprotective effect of EGCG was abolished when GA was applied in combination. To elucidate how a single dose of GA may interfere with EGCG, we focused on the anti-inflammatory, iron chelating and anti-oxidant properties of EGCG. Surprisingly, we observed that while EGCG induced a downregulation of the gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in affected CNS areas, the combined therapy of GA+EGCG seems to promote an increased HO-1 expression. These data suggest that upregulation of HO-1 may contribute to diminish the neuroprotective benefits of EGCG alone in this EAE model. Altogether, our data indicate that neuroprotection by EGCG in chronic EAE may involve regulation of oxidative processes, including downmodulation of HO-1. Further investigation of the re-dox balance in chronic neuroinflammation and in particular functional studies on HO-1 are warranted to understand its role in disease progression.

26115485|t|A Geographic Mosaic of Climate Change Impacts on Terrestrial Vegetation: Which Areas Are Most at Risk?
26115485|a|UNASSIGNED: Changes in climate projected for the 21st century are expected to trigger widespread and pervasive biotic impacts. Forecasting these changes and their implications for ecosystem services is a major research goal. Much of the research on biotic responses to climate change has focused on either projected shifts in individual species distributions or broad-scale changes in biome distributions. Here, we introduce a novel application of multinomial logistic regression as a powerful approach to model vegetation distributions and potential responses to 21st century climate change. We modeled the distribution of 22 major vegetation types, most defined by a single dominant woody species, across the San Francisco Bay Area. Predictor variables included climate and topographic variables. The novel aspect of our model is the output: a vector of relative probabilities for each vegetation type in each location within the study domain. The model was then projected for 54 future climate scenarios, spanning a representative range of temperature and precipitation projections from the CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles. We found that sensitivity of vegetation to climate change is highly heterogeneous across the region. Surprisingly, sensitivity to climate change is higher closer to the coast, on lower insolation, north-facing slopes and in areas of higher precipitation. While such sites may provide refugia for mesic and cool-adapted vegetation in the face of a warming climate, the model suggests they will still be highly dynamic and relatively sensitive to climate-driven vegetation transitions. The greater sensitivity of moist and low insolation sites is an unexpected outcome that challenges views on the location and stability of climate refugia. Projections provide a foundation for conservation planning and land management, and highlight the need for a greater understanding of the mechanisms and time scales of potential climate-driven vegetation transitions.

26113720|t|CORAL REEFS. Genomic determinants of coral heat tolerance across latitudes.
26113720|a|As global warming continues, reef-building corals could avoid local population declines through "genetic rescue" involving exchange of heat-tolerant genotypes across latitudes, but only if latitudinal variation in thermal tolerance is heritable. Here, we show an up-to-10-fold increase in odds of survival of coral larvae under heat stress when their parents come from a warmer lower-latitude location. Elevated thermal tolerance was associated with heritable differences in expression of oxidative, extracellular, transport, and mitochondrial functions that indicated a lack of prior stress. Moreover, two genomic regions strongly responded to selection for thermal tolerance in interlatitudinal crosses. These results demonstrate that variation in coral thermal tolerance across latitudes has a strong genetic basis and could serve as raw material for natural selection.

26114943|t|Understanding Collective Discontents: A Psychological Approach to Measuring Zeitgeist.
26114943|a|UNASSIGNED: Over the last decade, several countries around the world developed a collective sense of doom and gloom: Their Zeitgeist could be characterized as one of decline. Paradoxically, in some countries, such as the Netherlands, this collective discontent with society seems to exist despite high levels of individual well-being. Current psychological research informs us about why individuals would feel unduly optimistic, but does not account for a collective sense of decline. The present research develops a novel operationalization of Zeitgeist, referred to as a general factor Z. We conceptualize Zeitgeist as a collective global-level evaluation of the state (and future) of society. Three studies confirm that perceptions of the same societal problems at the personal and collective level differed strongly. Across these studies we found support for a hypothesized latent factor Z, underlying collective-level perceptions of society. This Z-factor predicted people's interpretation of new information about society that was presented through news stories. These results provide a first step in operationalizing and (ultimately) understanding the concept of Zeitgeist: collectively shared ideas about society. Implications for policy are discussed.

26114459|a|OBJECTIVE: To establish hand strength development trends in children with autism and to investigate correlations between grip and pinch strength, components of handwriting, and functional activities in children with and without autism. METHOD: Fifty-one children were divided into two groups: typically developing children and children on the autism spectrum. Each child completed testing for pinch and grip strength, handwriting legibility, pencil control, and independence in functional activities. RESULTS: The children with autism followed the same strength development trends as the typically developing children. Grip strength correlated with pencil control in both groups and with handwriting legibility in the typically developing children but not in the children with autism. Grip and pinch strength correlated with independence with functional activities in both groups. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that grip and pinch strength are important components in developing pencil control, handwriting legibility, and independence with functional fine motor tasks.

26086439|a|UNASSIGNED: The present study was conducted to determine the effect of dietary Cu deficiency and excess on carnitine status, kinetics and expression of CPT I in the liver and muscle of juvenile yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco. To this end, yellow catfish were fed 0.76 (Cu deficiency), 4.18 (adequate Cu) and 92.45 (Cu excess)mgCukg(-1) diet, respectively, for 8weeks. In the liver, Cu deficiency did not significantly affect the contents of FC, TC and AC, and the ratios of AC/FC and FC/TC. However, Cu excess reduced FC, TC and AC contents, and the ratio of AC/FC, but increased FC/TC ratio. In the muscle, dietary Cu levels showed no significant effects on the contents of FC, TC and AC as well as the ratio of FC/TC, but Cu excess significantly increased the ratio of AC/FC. Compared to the adequate Cu group, dietary Cu deficiency did not significantly affect the Vmax and Km values, and the ratio of Vmax/Km in the liver and muscle. However, Cu excess decreased Vmax and Vmax/Km ratio in the liver, and increased Vmax in the muscle. The mRNA expression of CPT Ia1a, CPT Ia1b, CPT Ia2a and CPT Ib in the liver and muscle was influenced by dietary Cu levels. To our knowledge, the present study provided, for the first time, evidence that dietary Cu deficiency and excess differentially influenced carnitine status, kinetics and expression profiles of CPT I of yellow catfish, which would extend our understanding on Cu nutrition in fish.

26101885|t|Latitudinal Gradient in Otolith Shape among Local Populations of Atlantic Herring (Clupea harengus L.) in Norway.
26101885|a|UNASSIGNED: Otolith shape analysis of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) in Norwegian waters shows significant differentiation among fjords and a latitudinal gradient along the coast where neighbouring populations are more similar to each other than to those sampled at larger distances. The otolith shape was obtained using quantitative shape analysis, the outlines were transformed with Wavelet and analysed with multivariate methods. The observed morphological differences are likely to reflect environmental differences but indicate low dispersal among the local herring populations. Otolith shape variation suggests also limited exchange between the local populations and their oceanic counterparts, which could be due to differences in spawning behaviour. Herring from the most northerly location (69  N) in Balsfjord, which is genetically more similar to Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), differed in otolith shape from all the other populations. Our results suggest that the semi-enclosed systems, where the local populations live and breed, are efficient barriers for dispersal. Otolith shape can thus serve as a marker to identify the origin of herring along the coast of Norway.

26101858|t|APO  2 and education in cognitively normal older subjects with high levels of AD pathology at autopsy: findings from the Nun Study.
26101858|a|UNASSIGNED: Asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (ASYMAD) subjects are individuals characterized by preserved cognition before death despite substantial AD pathology at autopsy. ASYMAD subjects show comparable levels of AD pathology, i.e. b-amyloid neuritic plaques (Ab-NP) and tau-neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), to those observed in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and some definite AD cases. Previous clinicopathologic studies on ASYMAD subjects have shown specific phenomena of hypertrophy in the cell bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and other cerebral areas. Since it is well established that the allele APO  4 is a major genetic risk factor for AD, we examined whether specific alleles of APOE could be associated with the different clinical outcomes between ASYMAD and MCI subjects despite equivalent AD pathology. A total of 523 brains from the Nun Study were screened for this investigation. The results showed higher APO  2 frequency (p < 0.001) in ASYMAD (19.2%) vs. MCI (0%) and vs. AD (4.7%). Furthermore, higher education in ASYMAD vs. MCI and AD (p < 0.05) was found. These novel autopsy-verified findings support the hypothesis of the beneficial effect of APO  2 and education, both which seem to act as contributing factors in delaying or forestalling the clinical manifestations of AD despite consistent levels of AD pathology.

26102203|t|Ionic liquid- and surfactant-controlled crystallization of WO3 films.
26102203|a|UNASSIGNED: WO3 films were obtained via evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) using ionic surfactants such as long-chain ionic liquids 1-hexadecyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride and bromide (C16mimCl and C16mimBr, respectively) and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride and bromide (CTAC and CTAB, respectively) as additives. Owing to the presence of the ionic surfactants, WO3 films crystallize in a preferred orientation along the a-axis on different substrates, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction. WO3 films with this orientation show improved electrochromic properties when compared to films with a lower degree of crystallographic orientation, prepared in an analogue fashion.

26099218|t|Dietary Cordyceps militaris protects against Vibrio splendidus infection in sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus.
26099218|a|UNASSIGNED: Vibrio splendidus is the common pathogen that causes infectious diseases widely spread in cultured sea cucumber in China. Therefore, we investigated the ability of Cordyceps militaris to protect against infection caused by V. splendidus. In this study, sea cucumbers were fed with a diet containing 0 (control), 1%, 2% or 3% C. militaris for 28 days, and subsequently challenged with V. splendidus by injection with 1.0*10(9) cfu per animal. Parameters of immune response such as phagocytosis (PC), lysozyme (LSZ) activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity and acid phosphatase (ACP) activity were determined on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 after injection. The results showed that dietary C. militaris at a dose of 2% or 3% significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05) all the immune parameters on day 0. One day after injection with V. splendidus, all the immune indices except ACP exhibited a tendency to decrease and then increase again, returning to the initial level on days 5 and/or 7 after injection. All the immune parameters of those fed with C. militaris were found significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of the control group on day 1 after injection. Only LSZ activity of those fed with 1%- or 3%-C. militaris diet on day 5 showed significantly increases (P < 0.05) than the controls. As for ACP activity, the values remained steady with time, but with significant increase (P < 0.05) seen in sea cucumbers fed with 2%-C. militaris diet, and lasted for up to 7 days after V. splendidus injection. The cumulative mortality of sea cucumbers fed with the basal diet followed V. splendidus infection was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those fed with 2% and 3% C. militaris diet. Under the experimental conditions, dietary C. militaris could enhance the immune responses of A. japonicus and improve its resistance to infection by V. splendidus.

26101515|t|A rare case of bilateral bronchial foreign body.
26101515|a|We present the case of a 7-year-old male patient with bilateral bronchial cocklebur fruit aspiration, which he sustained while playing. The patient presented with a triad of cough, wheezing, and decreased breath sounds (decreased in the right lung and absent in the left). These symptoms led to a diagnosis of bilateral bronchial foreign body, which was confirmed by computed tomography three-dimensional reconstruction of the bronchial tree. The patient was on the verge of death during operation but was ultimately rescued. Our therapeutic experience in treating this case of bilateral bronchial cocklebur fruit aspiration may provide a good reference for others.

26101191|t|Knowledge and Attitudes toward Non-invasive Prenatal Testing among Pregnant Japanese Women.
26101191|a|To assess the knowledge and attitudes of pregnant Japanese women regarding non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). Between March and June 2013, 557 pregnant women in the Hyogo and Hiroshima Prefectures were surveyed using an anonymous, self-completed questionnaire. A total of 91.9% respondents (512/557) stated that they "agree" or "conditionally agree" with NIPT implementation in Japan. Approximately 28.5% of respondents stated that they knew that the accuracy of a positive NIPT result can be affected by mother's age and background, while 34.5% of respondents stated that it was necessary for pregnant women with a positive result to undergo fetal chromosome diagnosis using amniocentesis;both percentages were low. Additionally, 92.3% of respondents would "like a detailed explanation of the test," 65.1% of them would "like psychological support if the NIPT test results came back positive," and 5.7% would terminate the pregnancy if the NIPT test results came back positive without undergoing fetal chromosome diagnosis via amniocentesis. Although a high proportion of pregnant Japanese women agreed with the introduction of NIPT into Japanese obstetrical care, there was insufficient knowledge regarding the test. It is necessary for women undergoing NIPT to be provided sufficient information and psychological support.

26100773|t|Acute nontraumatic general surgical conditions on a combat deployment.
26100773|a|BACKGROUND: Literature is lacking on acute surgical problems that may be encountered on military deployment; even less has been written on whether or not any of these surgical problems could have been avoided with more focused predeployment screening. We sought to determine the burden of illness attributable to acute nontraumatic general surgical problems while on deployment and to identify areas where more rigorous predeployment screening could be implemented to decrease surgical resource use for nontraumatic problems. METHODS: We studied all Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members deployed to Afghanistan between Feb. 7, 2006, and June 30, 2011, who required treatment for a nontraumatic general surgical condition. RESULTS: During the study period 28 990 CAF personnel deployed to Afghanistan; 373 (1.28%) were repatriated because of disease and 100 (0.34%) developed an acute general surgical condition. Among those who developed an acute surgical illness, 42 were combat personnel (42%) and 58 were support personnel (58%). Urologic diagnoses (n = 34) were the most frequent acute surgical conditions, followed by acute appendicitis (n = 18) and hernias (n = 12). We identified 5 areas where intensified predeployment screening could have potentially decreased the incidence of in-theatre acute surgical illness. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that there is a significant acute care surgery element encountered on combat deployment, and surgeons tasked with caring for this population should be prepared to treat these patients.

26107583|t|Quick Referral and Urgent Surgery to Preempt Foveal Detachment in Retinal Detachment Repair.
26107583|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the consultation and referral pathway and benefit of urgent surgery within 24 hours of outpatient clinic presentation on increasing the ratio of eyes with fovea-on at surgery and visual outcomes in retinal detachment cases. DESIGN: This is a retrospective, interventional case series. METHODS: A total of 106 eyes underwent an operation for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Standard vitrectomy or explant scleral buckling was performed. The ratio of eyes with fovea-on at the time of operation, anatomical success rate, and postoperative best corrected visual acuity were measured. RESULTS: Of the106 eyes, 46 (43.4%) already were fovea-off at initial eye clinic visit, and 9 eyes became fovea-off during referral. Consequently, 55 patients (51.9%) were fovea-off when presenting to our outpatient clinic. Retinal detachment was within 1 disc diameter of the fovea in 9 of 51 eyes with fovea-on at outpatient clinic presentation, but surgery within 24 hours spared 6 eyes from foveal involvement. The anatomical success rate of primary surgery was 98.8% (81/82 eyes) by vitrectomy and 83.3% (20/24 eyes) by scleral buckling. Postoperative best corrected visual acuity of the fovea-on group was significantly higher (mean [SD], -0.019 [0.22] logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution) than that of the fovea-off group (mean [SD], 0.32 [0.45] logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: More than half (51.9%) of our cohort had already been fovea-off by outpatient presentation. Therefore, efforts to urge patients to visit operating facilities promptly seem to be as important as the urgent surgeries themselves.

26101020|t|New diagnostic pathways urgently needed. Protocol of PET Guidance I pilot study: Positron Emission Tomography in suspected cardiac implantable electronic device - related infection.
26101020|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infection is a complication of increasing incidence. We present a protocol of an observational case control clinical trial "Positron Emission Tomography Combined With Computed Tomography (PET CT) in Suspected Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Infection, a Pilot Study - PET Guidance I" (NCT02196753). AIM: The aim of this observational clinical trial is to assess and standardize diagnostic algorithmsforCardiovascular Implantable Electronic Device (CIED) infections (lead dependent infective endocarditis, generator pocket infection, fever of unknown origin) with PET CT in Poland. METHODS AND RESULTS: Study group will consist of 20 pts with initial diagnosis of CIED-related infection paired with control group of 20 pts with implanted CIEDs who underwent PET CT due to other non infectious indications and have no data for infectious process in follow-up. All patients included in the study will undergo standard diagnostic process. Conventional/standard diagnostic and therapeutic process will consist of: medical interview, physical examination, laboratory tests, blood cultures; imaging studies: echocardiography: transthoracic (TTE), and if there are no contraindications transesophageal, computed tomography scan for pulmonary embolism if indicated; if there are abnormalities in other systems, decisions concerning further diagnostics will be made on physician discretion. Apart from standard diagnostic procedures patients will undergo whole body PET CT scan to localize infection or inflammation. Diagnosis and therapeutic decision will be obtained from the Study Committee. Follow-up will be held within 6 months with control visits at 3 and 6 month. During each follow-up visit, all patients will undergo laboratory tests, 2 blood cultures collected 1 hr apart, and echocardiography (TTE). In case of actual clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis or local generator pocket infection all patients will be referred for further diagnostics. Endpoints for the results assessment: Primary endpoints are to standardise PET CT in diagnostic process: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) of the diagnosis made by PET CT. Secondary endpoints are: assessment of usefulness of PET CT for detection of remote infective complications (metastatic abscesses, infected pulmonary emboli), incidence of particular localizations of infection, influence of PET CT on therapeutic decision: confirmation or change of decision based on PET CT, safety and complications of diagnostic process of CIED related infections with PET CT. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of positron emission computed tomography use for device-related infections in a case control study may be conclusive and improve diagnostic pathway.

26100364|t|Patterns of care and survival after a cancer of unknown primary (CUP) diagnosis: A population-based nested cohort study in Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs clients.
26100364|a|BACKGROUND: Little is known about patterns of care after a cancer of unknown primary (CUP) diagnosis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study to describe and compare the treatment, health service use and survival of patients with CUP and metastatic cancer of known primary among 143,956 Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs clients, 2004-2007. We randomly matched clients with CUP (C809; n=252) with clients with a first diagnosis of metastatic solid cancer of known primary (n=980). We ascertained health services from the month of diagnosis up to 2 months post-diagnosis for consultations, hospitalizations and emergency department visits, and up to 1 year for treatment. We compared cancer treatments using conditional logistic regression; consultation rates using negative binomial regression; and survival using stratified Cox regression. RESULTS: 30% of CUP patients and 70% of patients with known primary received cancer treatment and the median survival was 37 days and 310 days respectively. CUP patients received fewer cancer medicines (odds ratio (OR)=0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33-0.89) and less cancer-related surgery (OR=0.25, 95% CI 0.15-0.41); males with CUP received more radiation therapy (OR=2.88, 95% CI 1.69-4.91). CUP patients had more primary care consultations (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.25, 95% CI 1.11-1.41), emergency department visits (IRR=1.86, 95% CI 1.50-2.31) and hospitalizations (IRR=1.18, 95% CI 1.03-1.35), and a higher risk of death within 30 days (hazard ratio=3.30, 95% CI 1.69-6.44). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CUP receive less treatment but use more health services, which may reflect underlying patient and disease characteristics.

26102670|t|8B.04: RENAL ARTERY DENERVATION FOR TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS WITH OR WITHOUT OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA AND RESISTANT HYPERTENSION: RESULTS FROM THE GLOBAL SYMPLICITY REGISTRY.
26102670|a|OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with sympathetic nervous system activation and the development of hypertension. The Global SYMPLICITY Registry is prospectively enrolling real world patients with uncontrolled hypertension including patients with OSA. This analysis compares baseline characteristics and blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of renal denervation in patients with and without OSA. DESIGN AND METHOD: The Global SYMPL CITY Registry is a prospective, multicentre international registry designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of renal denervation in a broad population of patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Baseline characteristics antihypertensive medication use, office and 24-hour ambulatory BP are compared between patients with and without OSA. RESULTS: In a 998 patients with complete 6 month follow-up OSA was reported in 116 patients. OSA patients were more likely to be male than patients without OSA (n=752) (83% vs 56%, p<0.0001), had a larger body mass index (34  6kg/m2 vs 30  5kg/m2, p<0.0001) and significantly more, left ventricular hypertrophy (25% vs 15%, p=0.008) atrial fibrillation (19% vs 11%, p=0.020) and diabetes (52% vs 39%, p=0.008). OSA patients were taking more antihypertensive medications (4.9  1.4 vs 4.4  1.3, p<0.001); a higher proportion of aldosterone antagonists (39% vs 20%, p<0.0001), vasodilators (24% vs 13%, p=0.001) and alpha 2 agonists (54% vs 36%, p<0.001). Baseline office systolic BP was 166  23mm Hg for OSA patients and 163  24mm Hg for non-OSA patients. At 6 months the office systolic BP was reduced -15.5  24.4mm Hg in the OSA group and -11.3  25.0mm Hg in the non-OSA group (both p<0.0001; p=0.136 for difference between the groups). Baseline ambulatory 24-hr systolic BP was 156  20mm Hg in OSA patients and 152  17 in non-OSA patients. At 6 months 24-hour systolic BP declined -4.6  17.1mm Hg (n=73, p=0.023) in the OSA group and -7.1  17.6mm Hg (p<0.0001) in the non-OSA group (p=0.450 for the between group difference). CONCLUSIONS: Renal denervation resulted in significant 6-month BP reductions in patients with and without OSA but there was not a significant difference in the BP change between the 2 groups. Data from a larger cohort of 2100 patients will be presented.

26101546|t|Precipitate obtained following membrane separation of hydrothermally pretreated rice straw liquid revealed by 2D NMR to have high lignin content.
26101546|a|BACKGROUND: Hydrothermal pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass such as rice straw can dissolve part of the lignin and hemicellulose into a liquid fraction, thus facilitating enzyme accessibility to cellulose in bioethanol production process. Lignin is awaited to be recovered after hydrothermal pretreatment for utilization as value-added chemical, and lignin recovery also means removal of fermentation inhibitors. To recover lignin with high content from the liquid fraction, it is necessary to separate lignin and hemicellulose-derived polysaccharide. Therefore, the following processes were applied: membrane separation with nanofiltration (NF) and enzymatic hydrolysis by hemicellulase. To clarify lignin-concentrated fraction obtained during these processes, the fates of lignin and polysaccharide components were pursued by a solution NMR method and confirmed by compositional analysis of each fraction. RESULTS: After hydrothermal pretreatment of rice straw, the NF concentrate of the supernatant of liquid fraction was hydrolyzed by hemicellulase and the resulting black precipitate was recovered. In this black precipitate, the intensity of NMR spectra related to lignin aromatic regions increased and those related to polysaccharides decreased, compared to rice straw, the solid fraction after hydrothermal pretreatment, and the NF concentrate. The lignin content of the black precipitate was 65.8  %. Lignin in the black precipitate included 52.9  % of the acid-insoluble lignin and 19.4  % of the soluble lignin in the NF concentrate of supernatant of liquid fraction. CONCLUSION: A precipitate with high lignin content was obtained from supernatants of the liquid fraction. These results suggested that precipitation of lignin was enhanced from concentrated mixtures of lignin and hemicellulosic polysaccharides by hydrolyzing the polysaccharides. Precipitation of lignin can contribute to lignin recovery from lignocellulosic biomass and, at the same time, allow more efficient ethanol production in the subsequent fermentation process.

26112903|t|Angiotensin II directly impairs adipogenic differentiation of human preadipose cells.
26112903|a|UNASSIGNED: Angiotensin II reduces adipogenic differentiation of preadipose cells present in the stroma-vascular fraction of human adipose tissue, which also includes several cell types. Because of the ability of non-adipose lineage cells in the stroma-vascular fraction to respond to angiotensin II, it is not possible to unequivocally ascribe the anti-adipogenic response to a direct effect of this hormone on preadipose cells. Therefore, we used the human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) preadipocyte cell strain to investigate the consequences of angiotensin II treatment on adipogenic differentiation under serum-free conditions, by assessing expression of typical adipocyte markers perilipin and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), at the transcript and protein level. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that perilipin and FABP4 transcripts were, respectively, reduced to 0.33      0.07 (P  <  0.05) and 0.41      0.19-fold (P  <  0.05) in SGBS cells induced to adipogenic differentiation in the presence of angiotensin II. Western Blot analysis corroborated reduction of the corresponding proteins to 0.23      0.21 (P  <  0.01) and 0.46      0.30-fold (P  <  0.01) the respective controls without angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also impaired morphological changes associated with early adipogenesis. Hence, we demonstrated that angiotensin II is able to directly reduce adipogenic differentiation of SGBS preadipose cells.

26114730|t|Mathematical Modeling of Nitrous Oxide Production during Denitrifying Phosphorus Removal Process.
26114730|a|UNASSIGNED: Denitrifying phosphorus removal process undergoes frequent alternating anaerobic/anoxic conditions to achieve phosphate release and uptake, during which microbial internal storage polymers (e.g., Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)) could be produced and consumed dynamically. The PHA turnovers play important roles in nitrous oxide (N2O) accumulation during denitrifying phosphorus removal process. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to describe N2O dynamics and the key role of PHA consumption on N2O accumulation during denitrifying phosphorus removal process for the first time. In this model, the four-step anoxic storage of polyphosphate and four-step anoxic growth on PHA using nitrate, nitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and N2O consecutively by denitrifying poly-phosphate accumulating organisms (DPAOs) are taken into account for describing all potential N2O accumulation steps in denitrifying phosphorus removal process. The developed model is successfully applied to reproduce experimental data on N2O production obtained from four independent denitrifying phosphorus removal study reports with different experimental conditions. The model satisfactorily describes the N2O accumulation, nitrogen reduction, phosphate release and uptake and PHA dynamics for all systems, suggesting the validity and applicability of the model. The results indicated a substantial role of PHA consumption on N2O accumulation due to the relatively low N2O reduction rate by using PHA during denitrifying phosphorus removal.

26115025|t|Minimally invasive resection of lumbar intraspinal synovial cysts via a contralateral approach: review of 13 cases.
26115025|a|UNASSIGNED: OBJECT The authors sought to determine patient-related outcomes after minimally invasive surgical (MIS) lumbar intra-spinal synovial cyst excision via a tubular working channel and a contralateral facet-sparing approach. METHODS All the patients with a symptomatic lumbar intraspinal synovial cyst who underwent surgery at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics with an MIS excision via a contralateral approach were treated between July 2010 and August 2014. There was a total of 13 cases. Each patient was evaluated with preoperative neurological examinations, lumbar spine radiography, MRI, and visual analog scale (VAS) scores. The patients were evaluated postoperatively with neurological examinations and VAS and Macnab scores. The primary outcomes were improvement in VAS and Macnab scores. Secondary outcomes were average blood loss, hospital stay duration, and operative times. RESULTS There were 5 males and 8 females. The mean age was 66 years, and the mean body mass index was 28.5 kg/m(2). Sixty-nine percent (9 of 13) of the cysts were at L4-5. Most patients had low-back pain and radicular pain, and one-third of them had Grade 1 spondylolisthesis. The mean (   SD) follow-up duration was 20.8    16.9 months. The mean Macnab score was 3.4    1.0, and the VAS score decreased from 7.8 preoperatively to 2.9 postoperatively. The mean operative time was 123    30 minutes, with a mean estimated blood loss of 44    29 ml. Hospital stay averaged 1.5    0.7 days. There were no complications noted in this series. CONCLUSIONS The MIS excision of lumbar intraspinal synovial cysts via a contralateral approach offers excellent exposure to the cyst and spares the facet joint at the involved level, thus minimizing risk of instability, blood loss, operative time, and hospital stay. Prospective randomized trials with longer follow-up times and larger cohorts are needed to conclusively determine the superiority of the contralateral MIS approach over others, including open or ipsilateral minimally invasive surgery.

26086716|t|C15H10 and C15H12 Thermal Chemistry: Phenanthrylcarbene Isomers and Phenylindenes by Falling Solid Flash Vacuum Pyrolysis of Tetrazoles.
26086716|a|UNASSIGNED: 2-Phenyl-5-(phenylethynyl)tetrazole 44 provides a new entry to the C15H10 energy surface. Flash vacuum pyrolysis of 44 using the falling solid flash vacuum pyrolysis (FS-FVP) method afforded cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene 31 and cyclopenta[jk]fluorene 52 as the principal products. The products are explained in terms of the formation of N-phenyl-C-phenylethynylnitrile imine/(phenylazo)(phenylethynyl)carbene 45 and its cyclization to 3-(phenylethynyl)-3H-indazole 46b. Pyrolytic loss of N2 from 46b generates C15H10 intermediate 48. Cyclization of 48 to a dibenzocycloheptatetraene derivative and further rearrangements with analogies in the chemistry of phenylcarbene and the naphthylcarbenes leads to the final products. Similar pyrolysis of 2-phenyl-5-styryltetrazole 43 afforded 3-styrylindazole 58, which on further pyrolysis eliminated N2 to generate 3- and 2-phenylindenes 61 and 62 via C15H12 intermediates.

26113537|t|Manganese lipoxygenase of Fusarium oxysporum and the structural basis for biosynthesis of distinct 11-hydroperoxy stereoisomers.
26113537|a|UNASSIGNED: The biosynthesis of jasmonates in plants is initiated by13S-lipoxygenase (13S-LOX), but details of jasmonate biosynthesis by fungi, including Fusarium oxysporum, are unknown. The genome of F. oxysporum codes for linoleate 13S-LOX (FoxLOX) and for Fo-MnLOX, an uncharacterized homologue of 13R-MnLOX of Gaeumannomyces graminis. We expressed Fo-MnLOX and compared its properties to Cg-MnLOX from Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Fo-MnLOX oxidized 18:2n-6 mainly to 11R-HPODE, 13S-HPODE, and 9(S/R)-HPODE, whereas Cg-MnLOX produced 9S-, 11S-, and 13R-HPODE with high stereoselectivity. The 11-hydroperoxides did not undergo the rapid b-fragmentation earlier observed with 13R-MnLOX. EPR and metal analysis showed that Fo-MnLOX contained catalytic Mn. Oxidation of [11S-2H]18:2n-6 by Cg-MnLOX was accompanied by loss of deuterium and a large kinetic isotope effect (>30). The Fo-MnLOX-catalyzed oxidation occurred with retention of the 2H-label. Fo-MnLOX also oxidized La-lyso-glycerophosphatidylcholine. The predicted active site of all MnLOXs contains Phe except for Ser348 in this position of Fo-MnLOX. The Ser348Phe mutant of Fo-MnLOX oxidized 18:2n-6 to the same major products as Cg-MnLOX. Our results suggest that Fo-MnLOX with support of Ser348 binds 18:2n-6 so that the proR rather than the proS hydrogen at C-11 interacts with the metal center, but retains the suprafacial oxygenation mechanism observed in other MnLOXs.

26111549|t|Synthesis and evaluation of 1,4-naphthoquinone ether derivatives as SmTGR inhibitors and new antischistosomal drugs.
26111549|a|UNASSIGNED: Investigations on the chemistry and mechanism of action of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (or menadione) derivatives, revealed 3-phenoxymethyl menadiones as a novel antischistosomal series. These newly synthesized compounds 1-7 and their difluoromethylmenadione counterparts 8-9 were found to be potent and specific inhibitors of Schistosoma mansoni thioredoxin-glutathione reductase (SmTGR) identified as a potential target. The compounds were also tested in enzymic assays using both human flavoenzymes, i.e. the glutathione reductase (hGR) and the selenium-dependent human thioredoxin reductase (hTrxR) to evaluate the specificity of the inhibition. Structure-activity relationships as well as physico- and electro-chemical studies showed a high potential for the 3-phenoxymethyl menadiones to inhibit SmTGR selectively versus hGR and hTrxR enzymes, in particular those bearing a-fluorophenol methyl ether moieties to improve antischistosomal action. In particular, the (substituted phenoxy)methyl menadione derivative 7 displayed time-dependent SmTGR inactivation, correlating with unproductive NADPH-dependent redox-cycling of SmTGR, and potent antischistosomal action in ex vivo worms. In contrast, the difluoromethylmenadione analogue 9, which inactivates SmTGR through an irreversible non-consuming NADPH-dependent process, has little killing effect in cultured ex vivo worms. Because none of the compounds tested in vivo was active, a limited bioavailability might compromise compound activity and future studies will be directed toward improving pharmacokinetics properties.

26115014|t|Pullulanase and Starch Synthase III Are Associated with Formation of Vitreous Endosperm in Quality Protein Maize.
26115014|a|UNASSIGNED: The opaque-2 (o2) mutation of maize increases lysine content, but the low seed density and soft texture of this type of mutant are undesirable. Lines with modifiers of the soft kernel phenotype (mo2) called "Quality Protein Maize" (QPM) have high lysine and kernel phenotypes similar to normal maize. Prior research indicated that the formation of vitreous endosperm in QPM might involve changes in starch granule structure. In this study, we focused on analysis of two starch biosynthetic enzymes that may influence kernel vitreousness. Analysis of recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross of W64Ao2 and K0326Y revealed that pullulanase activity had significant positive correlation with kernel vitreousness. We also found that decreased Starch Synthase III abundance may decrease the pullulanase activity and average glucan chain length given the same Zpu1 genotype. Therefore, Starch Synthase III could indirectly influence the kernel vitreousness by affecting pullulanase activity and coordinating with pullulanase to alter the glucan chain length distribution of amylopectin, resulting in different starch structural properties. The glucan chain length distribution had strong positive correlation with the polydispersity index of glucan chains, which was positively associated with the kernel vitreousness based on nonlinear regression analysis. Therefore, we propose that pullulanase and Starch Synthase III are two important factors responsible for the formation of the vitreous phenotype of QPM endosperms.

26119577|t|Cultural influences on exercise participation and fall prevention: a systematic review and narrative synthesis.
26119577|a|PURPOSE: We aim to provide a systematic review of qualitative research evidence relevant to the experiences and perceptions of program providers and participants from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds regarding (i) exercise and (ii) fall prevention programs for older people. METHOD: Using a narrative synthesis approach, we reviewed published journal articles reporting qualitative data. Electronic and manual literature searches were conducted to identify 19 publications that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 16 discussed exercise and three focused on broader fall prevention programs. However, no studies were identified that explored the perspective of the program providers. RESULTS: An overarching theme emerged identifying the influence of cultural values and perceptions on program participation. Also, identified were motivational, social and environmental influences. CONCLUSION: Exercise and fall prevention interventions need to be culturally appropriate and utilise the positive influences of social support, especially from physicians and family. While these findings can be used to inform the delivery of programs to these population groups, future studies should focus specifically on experiences and perceptions of older CALD people of fall prevention programs as well as the perspectives of program providers. Implications for Rehabilitation Program participation is influenced by cultural values and motivational, social and environmental factors. The meaning and importance of exercise can vary between and within cultures. Exercise and fall prevention interventions need to be culturally appropriate and utilise the positive influences of social support, especially from physicians and family. Providing information that falls can be prevented and the reasons why behaviours need to change will be more likely to encourage older people from CALD backgrounds to contemplate participation.

26111997|t|Exploring erythropoiesis of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) using an in  vitro colony assay in the presence of recombinant carp kit ligand A and erythropoietin.
26111997|a|UNASSIGNED: The use of in  vitro colony assays in mammals has contributed to identification of erythroid progenitor cells such as burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) progenitors, and serves to examine functions of erythropoietic growth factors like Erythropoietin (Epo) and Kit ligand. Here, we established an in  vitro colony-forming assay capable of investigating erythropoiesis in carp (Cyprinus carpio), cloned and functionally characterized recombinant homologous molecules Epo and Kit ligand A (Kitla), and identified three distinct erythroid progenitor cells in carp. Recombinant carp Epo induced the formation of CFU-E-like and BFU-E-like erythroid colonies, expressing erythroid marker genes, b-globin, epor and gata1. Recombinant carp Kitla alone induced limited colony formation, whereas a combination of Kitla and Epo dramatically enhanced erythroid colony formation and colony cell growth, as well as stimulated the formation of thrombocytic/erythroid colonies expressing not only erythroid markers but also thrombocytic markers, cd41 and c-mpl. Utilizing this colony assay to examine the distribution of distinct erythroid progenitor cells in carp, we demonstrated that carp head and trunk kidney play a primary role in erythropoiesis, while the spleen plays a secondary. Furthermore, we showed that presumably bi-potent thrombocytic/erythroid progenitor cells localize principally in the trunk kidney. Our results indicate that teleost fish possess mechanisms of Epo- and Kitla-dependent erythropoiesis similar to those in other vertebrates, and also help to demonstrate the diversity of erythropoietic sites among vertebrates.

26121180|t|Quality of Life in Head and Neck Cancer Patient-Caregiver Dyads: A Systematic Review.
26121180|a|BACKGROUND: As we learn about patient experiences with head and neck cancer, it is also important to consider caregivers so that family-centered care can be improved. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review was to (a) identify the research questions, methods, and measures that have been examined in quality-of-life studies with head and neck cancer patients and their caregivers (dyads) and (b) identify gaps and future directions for research and practice. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of electronic databases using keywords (head and neck cancer, caregiver, quality of life) and included studies that assessed quality of life-related constructs in both patients and caregivers. A dyadic quality-of-life conceptual model guided the summary of observations. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met eligibility criteria. The most common research questions included comparing patient and caregiver quality of life, examining relationships between personal and clinical factors in 1 dyad member and a quality-of-life outcome in the other, and exploring relationships between interpersonal processes and quality of life. Psychological quality-of-life constructs were most commonly studied. There was substantial variability in study findings, in part due to differences in study questions and samples. CONCLUSIONS: Future research is needed to examine longitudinal interpersonal processes in head and neck cancer. Unique caregiving tasks should be inventoried, and dyadic data analysis techniques should be used. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Head and neck cancer dramatically affects quality of life in patients and caregivers, and quality clinical care requires a dyadic focus. Oncology nurses have a unique opportunity to develop and implement dyadic illness management models for head and neck cancer.

26006005|t|Symmetry of charge order in cuprates.
26006005|a|UNASSIGNED: Charge-ordered ground states permeate the phenomenology of 3d-based transition metal oxides, and more generally represent a distinctive hallmark of strongly correlated states of matter. The recent discovery of charge order in various cuprate families has fuelled new interest into the role played by this incipient broken symmetry within the complex phase diagram of high-Tc superconductors. Here, we use resonant X-ray scattering to resolve the main characteristics of the charge-modulated state in two cuprate families: Bi2Sr2-xLaxCuO6+   (Bi2201) and YBa2Cu3O6+y (YBCO). We detect no signatures of spatial modulations along the nodal direction in Bi2201, thus clarifying the inter-unit-cell momentum structure of charge order. We also resolve the intra-unit-cell symmetry of the charge-ordered state, which is revealed to be best represented by a bond order with modulated charges on the O-2p orbitals and a prominent d-wave character. These results provide insights into the origin and microscopic description of charge order in cuprates, and its interplay with superconductivity.

26003925|t|The 'BlueScreen HC' assay as a decision making test in the genotoxicity assessment of flavour and fragrance materials.
26003925|a|UNASSIGNED: The genotoxicity of a library of 70 flavour and fragrance substances having a high proportion of in vivo and/or carcinogenicity test data has been assessed using the GADD45a-GLuc 'BlueScreen HC' genotoxicity assay, with and without exogenous metabolic activation. There are only limited genotoxicity and carcinogenicity study data for compounds in this applicability domain, but this study allowed the following conclusions: (i) The BlueScreen HC results are highly predictive of positive results from regulator-required in vitro genotoxicity assays for the test set of materials; the moderate negative predictivity of BlueScreen HC from the in vitro test set of material is mainly due to the high rate of false positive in regulatory in vitro mammalian tests. (ii) BlueScreen HC negative results are predictive of negative in vivo results and provide a specific prediction of in vivo genotoxicity assay results. (iii) In this applicability domain, which comprises a large proportion of relatively low molecular weight molecules, a 1mM testing limit maintains the sensitivity of the assay, and increases specificity. (iv) The predictive capacity and specificity to in vivo genotoxins and carcinogens, coupled to a microplate format with low compound requirement supports further investigation of the BlueScreen HC assay as a useful tool in prioritizing the assessment of new F_F materials and in filling data gaps on materials with no or limited regulatory test data for genotoxicity.

26079493|t|Interpolation of orientation distribution functions in diffusion weighted imaging using multi-tensor model.
26079493|a|BACKGROUND: Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a non-invasive method for investigating the brain white matter structure and can be used to evaluate fiber bundles. However, due to practical constraints, DWI data acquired in clinics are low resolution. NEW METHOD: This paper proposes a method for interpolation of orientation distribution functions (ODFs). To this end, fuzzy clustering is applied to segment ODFs based on the principal diffusion directions (PDDs). Next, a cluster is modeled by a tensor so that an ODF is represented by a mixture of tensors. For interpolation, each tensor is rotated separately. RESULTS: The method is applied on the synthetic and real DWI data of control and epileptic subjects. Both experiments illustrate capability of the method in increasing spatial resolution of the data in the ODF field properly. The real dataset show that the method is capable of reliable identification of differences between temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients and normal subjects. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The method is compared to existing methods. Comparison studies show that the proposed method generates smaller angular errors relative to the existing methods. Another advantage of the method is that it does not require an iterative algorithm to find the tensors. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is appropriate for increasing resolution in the ODF field and can be applied to clinical data to improve evaluation of white matter fibers in the brain.

26112832|t|Molecular genetic variation and structure of Southeast Asian crocodile (Tomistoma schlegelii): Comparative potentials of SSRs versus ISSRs.
26112832|a|UNASSIGNED: Tomistoma schlegelii, also referred to as the "false gharial", is one of the most exclusive and least known of the world's fresh water crocodilians, limited to Southeast Asia. Indeed, lack of economic value for its skin has led to neglect the biodiversity of the species. The current study aimed to investigate the mentioned case using 40 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs and 45 inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers. DNA analysis of 17 T. schlegelii samples using the SSR and ISSR markers resulted in producing a total of 49 and 108 polymorphic bands, respectively. Furthermore, the SSR- and ISSR-based cluster analyses both generated two main clusters. However, the SSR based results were found to be more in line with the geographical distributions of the crocodile samples collected across the country as compared with the ISSR-based results. The observed heterozygosity (HO) and expected heterozygosity (HE) of the polymorphic SSRs ranged between 0.588-1 and 0.470-0.891, respectively. The present results suggest that the Malaysian T. schlegelii populations had originated from a core population of crocodiles. In cooperation with the SSR markers, the ISSRs showed high potential for studying the genetic variation of T. schlegelii, and these markers are suitable to be employed in conservation genetic programs of this endangered species. Both SSR- and ISSR-based STRUCTURE analyses suggested that all the individuals of T. schlegelii are genetically similar with each other.

26118550|t|Influence of the Metal Work Function on the Photocatalytic Properties of TiO2 Layers on Metals.
26118550|a|UNASSIGNED: The photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide (TiO2 ) layers on different metal plates are investigated. The metal-semiconductor interface can be described as a Schottky contact, and is part of a depletion layer for the majority carriers in the semiconductor. Many researchers have demonstrated an increase in the photocatalytic activity, due to the formation of a metal-semiconductor contact that are obtained by deposition of small metal islands on the semiconductor. Nevertheless, the influence of a Schottky contact remains uncertain, sparking much interest in this field. The immobilization of nanoparticulate TiO2 layers by dip-coating on different metal substrates results in the formation of a Schottky contact. The recombination rate of photoinduced electron-hole pairs decreases at this interface provided that the thickness of the thin TiO2 layer has a similar magnitude to the depletion layer. The degradation of dichloroacetic acid in aqueous solution and of acetaldehyde in a gas mixture is investigated to obtain information concerning the influence of the metal work function of the back contact on the efficiency of the photocatalytic process.

26081705|t|[The relationship between the KIF1B (rs17401966) single nucleotide polymorphism and the genetic susceptibility to Hepatocellular carcinoma].
26081705|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between SNP rs17401966 at the KIF1B gene and the genetic susceptibility to Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: All study objects were recruited from two Grade A hospitals of Amoy from January 2011 to October 2014.They were surveyed in individual matching case-control study. Accepting criterias in the cases: HCC was first diagnosed based on diagnostic basis during the investigations, over 18 years old, present addresses were as same as surveyed areas in the district (county) level range, no past history of cancers; Exclusion criterias: patients with other liver diseases. The tumor patients without HCC, patients with autoimmune hepatitis or toxic hepatitis, patients who refused to be investigated or too ill to be investigated. Accepting criterias in the controls: the control who passed the physical examination matched the case in ages (no more than 3 years old), sex, health screening in the same hospital over the same period and district (county); Exclusion criterias: people with liver disease or any history of cancers. This study consisted of 376 HCC patients and 403 controls, 5 ml morning fasting venous blood of all subjects were obtained to isolate cells and distribute genotype. The differences in general information between cases and controls were tested by   (2) test and t-test. The association between SNP rs17401966 and the risk of developing HCC were assessed by using the multiple factors logistic regression. RESULTS: The mean age and standard deviation for case and control groups were (61.7    12.8) years and (60.6    12.7) years (t = 1.15, P = 0.251), respectively. The proportion of family history of cancer [28.7% (108/376)] and the HBsAg positive rate [26.9 % (101/376)] in case group were higher than these in control group [15.9% (64/403), 2.7% (11/403)] (  (2) = 18.65, 92.02, P < 0.001). In HBsAg carriers, GG genotype genetic susceptibility to HCC is 0.12 (0.02-0.75) times for AA genotype, and G allele susceptibility to HCC is 0.38 (0.15-0.98) times for A allelc. In HBsAg negative group, it showed no statistical significance in the relationship between SNP rs17401966 and susceptibility to HCC, and compared with the A allele, the risk for HCC of G allele is 0.79 (0.62-1.01). CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that the presence of the GG genotype, the GA genotype and the G allele at rs17401966 of the KIF1B gene might decrease the risk for HCC.

26081405|a|OBJECTIVE: A Meta-analysis was performed to assess the association of defective hepatic cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) gene with smoking behaviors. METHODS: All eligible studies published up to 2014 were searched out from PubMed, China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI), ISI Web of knowledge (ISI), vip citation databases (VIP), Chinese BioMedical Literature (CBM) and Elsevier Science Direct, searching words were "smok*","nicotine dependence","CYP2A6","cytochrome P450 2A6","polymorphism","mut*"and"varia*", while 436 articles were concluded. Meta-analysis was performed using Statal 3.1. RESULTS: A total of ten studies were finally included. We didn't find a significant effect of defective CYP2A6 gene on smoking initiation (fixed effect model (FEM): OR = 0.90, 95%CI: 0.78-1.03, I(2) = 25.8%), smoking persistence (random effect model (REM): OR = 0.85, 95%CI: 0.59-1.23, I(2) = 66.3%) and smoking cessation (REM: OR = 0.89, 95%CI: 0.57-1.40, I(2) = 67.1%). But it showed a significant protective effect of CYP2A6*4 on smoking initiation (FEM: OR = 0.78, 95%CI: 0.61-0.99, I(2) = 28.2%), smoking persistence (FEM: OR = 0.53, 95%CI: 0.36-0.77, I(2) = 41.0%) and smoking cessation (REM: OR = 0.49, 95%CI: 0.31-0.80, I(2) = 0.0%). CONCLUSIONS: This Meta-analysis suggested that there was not a protective effect of defective CYP2A6 gene against smoking behaviors. But smokers with whole CYP2A6 gene deletion would be less likely to start smoking, less smoking persistence and more likely to quit smoking successful than smokers with wild CYP2A6 gene.

26067076|t|Nutrition Knowledge and Practices of Varsity Coaches at a Canadian University.
26067076|a|PURPOSE: Coaches' sports nutrition knowledge and subsequent nutrition recommendations can have an impact on athletes' health and performance. The purpose of this study was to determine sports nutrition knowledge and nutrition recommendation practices of varsity coaches at one Canadian university and to determine if the coaches' nutrition knowledge influenced nutrition recommendations to athletes. The coaches' accessibility to sports dietitians was also examined. METHODS: Coaches (n = 5) completed a modified psychometrically validated nutrition knowledge questionnaire and a semi-structured interview. Mean scores were calculated for questionnaire answers based on the correct answer and the coach's degree of certainty in their answer. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Results showed a low nutrition knowledge, yet all coaches made nutrition recommendations to their athletes for fluid needs, dietary supplementation, and weight management; areas that may be potentially detrimental to the health of athletes. In addition, they made recommendations with regard to fluid needs, training diet, precompetition diet, recovery diet (i.e., post training or competition), dietary supplementation, and weight management; areas that could have potentially negative performance consequences to the athlete. CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that coaches had low nutrition knowledge scores and still made nutrition recommendations to athletes. The importance of sports dietitian involvement in varsity athletics is emphasized.

26074656|t|Enhancing Tax Compliance through Coercive and Legitimate Power of Tax Authorities by Concurrently Diminishing or Facilitating Trust in Tax Authorities.
26074656|a|UNASSIGNED: Both coercion, such as strict auditing and the use of fines, and legitimate procedures, such as assistance by tax authorities, are often discussed as means of enhancing tax compliance. However, the psychological mechanisms that determine the effectiveness of each strategy are not clear. Although highly relevant, there is rare empirical literature examining the effects of both strategies applied in combination. It is assumed that coercion decreases implicit trust in tax authorities, leading to the perception of a hostile antagonistic tax climate and enforced tax compliance. Conversely, it is suggested that legitimate power increases reason-based trust in the tax authorities, leading to the perception of a service climate and eventually to voluntary cooperation. The combination of both strategies is assumed to cause greater levels of intended compliance than each strategy alone. We conducted two experimental studies with convenience samples of 261 taxpayers overall. The studies describe tax authorities as having low or high coercive power (e.g., imposing lenient or severe sanctions) and/or low or high legitimate power (e.g., having nontransparent or transparent procedures). Data analyses provide supportive evidence for the assumptions regarding the impact on intended tax compliance. Coercive power did not reduce implicit trust in tax authorities; however, it had an effect on reason-based trust, interaction climate, and intended tax compliance if applied solely. When wielded in combination with legitimate power, it had no effect.

26075225|t|The Janus Facet of Nanomaterials.
26075225|a|UNASSIGNED: Application of nanoscale materials (NMs) displays a rapidly increasing trend in electronics, optics, chemical catalysis, biotechnology, and medicine due to versatile nature of NMs and easily adjustable physical, physicochemical, and chemical properties. However, the increasing abundance of NMs also poses significant new and emerging health and environmental risks. Despite growing efforts, understanding toxicity of NMs does not seem to cope with the demand, because NMs usually act entirely different from those of conventional small molecule drugs. Currently, large-scale application of available safety assessment protocols, as well as their furthering through case-by-case practice, is advisable. We define a standard work-scheme for nanotoxicity evaluation of NMs, comprising thorough characterization of structural, physical, physicochemical, and chemical traits, followed by measuring biodistribution in live tissue and blood combined with investigation of organ-specific effects especially regarding the function of the brain and the liver. We propose a range of biochemical, cellular, and immunological processes to be explored in order to provide information on the early effects of NMs on some basic physiological functions and chemical defense mechanisms. Together, these contributions give an overview with important implications for the understanding of many aspects of nanotoxicity.

26080741|a|Bacterial wilts of potato, tomato, pepper, and or eggplant caused by Ralstonia solanacearum are among the most serious plant diseases worldwide. In this study, the issue of developing bactericidal agents from natural sources against R. solanacearum derived from plant extracts was addressed. Extracts prepared from 25 plant species with antiseptic relevance in Egyptian folk medicine were screened for their antimicrobial properties against the potato pathogen R. solancearum by using the disc-zone inhibition assay and microtitre plate dilution method. Plants exhibiting notable antimicrobial activities against the tested pathogen include extracts from Acacia arabica and Punica granatum. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of A. arabica and P. granatum resulted in the isolation of bioactive compounds 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid and gallic acid, in addition to epicatechin. All isolates displayed significant antimicrobial activities against R. solanacearum (MIC values 0.5-9   mg/ml), with 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid being the most effective one with a MIC value of 0.47   mg/ml. We further performed a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study for the inhibition of R. solanacearum growth by ten natural, structurally related benzoic acids.

26070495|t|Learning style preferences of surgical residency applicants.
26070495|a|BACKGROUND: The learning style preferences of general surgery residents have been previously reported; there is evidence that residents who prefer read/write learning styles perform better on the American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE). However, little is known regarding the learning style preferences of applicants to general surgery residency and their impact on educational outcomes. In this study, the preferred learning styles of surgical residency applicants were determined. We hypothesized that applicant rank data are associated with specific learning style preferences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Fleming VARK learning styles inventory was offered to all general surgery residency applicants that were interviewed at a university hospital-based program. The VARK model categorizes learners as visual (V), aural (A), read/write (R), kinesthetic (K), or multimodal (MM). Responses on the inventory were scored to determine the preferred learning style for each applicant. Applicant data, including United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) scores, class rank, interview score, and overall final applicant ranking, were examined for association with preferred learning styles. RESULTS: Sixty-seven applicants were interviewed. Five applicants were excluded due to not completing the VARK inventory or having incomplete applicant data. The remaining 62 applicants (92%) were included for analysis. Most applicants (57%) had a multimodal preference. Sixty-nine percent of all applicants had some degree of preference for kinesthetic learning. There were statistically significant differences between applicants of different learning styles in terms of USMLE step 1 scores (P  =  0.001) and USMLE step 2 clinical knowledge scores (P  =  0.01), but not for class ranks (P  =  0.27), interview scores (P  =  0.20), or final ranks (P  =  0.14). Multiple comparison analysis demonstrated that applicants with aural preferences had higher USMLE 1 scores (233.2) than those with kinesthetic (211.8, P  =  0.005) or multimodal (214.5, P  =  0.008) preferences, whereas applicants with visual preferences had higher USMLE 1 scores (230.0) than those with kinesthetic preferences (P  =  0.047). Applicants with aural preferences also had higher USMLE 2 scores (249.6) than those with kinesthetic (227.6, P  =  0.006) or multimodal (230.1, P  =  0.008) preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Most applicants to general surgery residency have a multimodal learning style preference. Learning style preferences are associated with higher USMLE step 1 and step 2 scores, in particular for applicants with aural preferences. Students who performed well in lecture-dominated medical school environments because of their aural preferences could be at a disadvantage in the more independent, reading-focused learning environments of surgical residency.

26060773|t|The Effects of Unemployment Rate on Health Status of Chinese People.
26060773|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to estimate the short-run and long-run effects of unemployment rate on health outcomes of Chinese population, which is under studied before. METHODS: The Chinese aggregate data was analyzed (provincial data from 1990-2011). The fixed effect model and infinite distributed lag model (IDL) were applied to analyze the data. It aimed to estimate the short-run and long-run association between unemployment rate and health status of population in China. The mortality was applied as an indicator for health outcomes of entire population. RESULTS: In the short run, when the unemployment rate was decreased by 1%, mortality will be reduced by approximately 4 % (P<0.01). In the long-run, mortality will be increased by 6.8% with increased unemployment rate of 1% (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: The result in China demonstrated that the unemployment rate was positively associated with mortality. The result also showed that the increased unemployment rate has been harmful to health outcomes of population. It will be significant to reduce the unemployment rate for improving potential public health benefits in developing countries like China.

26059094|a|OBJECTIVE: There is considerable controversy about the significance and appropriate treatment of type II endoleaks (T2Ls) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). We report our long-term experience with T2L management in a large multicenter registry. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2010, 1736 patients underwent EVAR, and we recorded the incidence of T2L. Primary outcomes were mortality and aneurysm-related mortality (ARM). Secondary outcomes were change in aneurysm sac size, major adverse events, and reintervention. RESULTS: During the follow-up (median of 32.2  months; interquartile range, 14.2-52.8  months), T2L was identified in 474 patients (27.3%). There were no late abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures attributable to a T2L. Overall mortality (P  = .47) and ARM (P  = .26) did not differ between patients with and without T2L. Sac growth (median, 5  mm; interquartile range, 2-10  mm) was seen in 213 (44.9%) of the patients with T2L. Of these patients with a T2L and sac growth, 36 (16.9%) had an additional type of endoleak. Of all patients with T2L, 111 (23.4%) received reinterventions, including 39 patients who underwent multiple procedures; 74% of the reinterventions were performed in patients with sac growth. Reinterventions included lumbar embolization in 66 patients (59.5%), placement of additional stents in 48 (43.2%), open surgical revision in 14 (12.6%), and direct sac injection in 22 (19.8%). The reintervention was successful in 35 patients (31.5%). After patients with other types of endoleak were excluded, no difference in overall all-cause mortality (P  = .57) or ARM (P  = .09) was observed between patients with T2L-associated sac growth who underwent reintervention and those in whom T2L was left untreated. CONCLUSIONS: In our multicenter EVAR registry, overall all-cause mortality and ARM were unaffected by the presence of a T2L. Moreover, patients who were simply observed for T2L-associated sac growth had aneurysm-related outcomes similar to those in patients who underwent reintervention. Our future work will investigate the most cost-effective ways to select patients for intervention besides sac growth alone.

26041483|t|Activated carbon for aerobic oxidation: Benign approach toward 2-benzoylbenzimidazoles and 2-benzoylbenzoxazoles synthesis.
26041483|a|A general strategy involving a novel and highly efficient aerobic benzylic oxidation promoted by cheap, reusable activated carbon in water is developed. Application of this method has been demonstrated in the benign synthesis of bioactive 2-benzoylbenzimidazoles and 2-benzoylbenzoxazoles derivatives. Furthermore, the activated carbon catalyst could be recovered and reused at least three times without significantly losing its activity. Preliminary research suggests that the oxidation mechanism may involve intermediate hydroperoxidation and that a portion of the final carbonyl product is obtained through a secondary benzylic alcohol intermediate. Finally, theoretical calculations reveal that the oxidation yield is closely associated with the electric density at the benzylic position of the substrate.

26041201|t|Hydrogenolytic depolymerization of procyanidin polymers from hi-tannin sorghum bran.
26041201|a|Depolymerization of procyanidin polymers into oligomers enhances their bioavailability and bioactivity because oligomers are bioavailable. Hydrogenolysis was applied in this study to depolymerize hi-tannin sorghum bran procyanidin polymers into oligomers. The yield and composition of oligomers under different hydrogenolysis conditions was investigated. Results showed that raising temperature from 50 to 100  C significantly increased total yield of oligomers. Higher temperatures (150 and 200  C) produced monomers with lower yield. The highest yield of oligomers (38.8%) was obtained using 1MPa hydrogen whereas 3MPa hydrogen in reaction vessel decreased yield. Total yield of oligomers reached the highest at 1-3h and then decreased with prolonged reaction time. Yield increased with palladium-on-carbon (Pd/C, a catalyst) amount from 0.5 to 3mg and plateaued with Pd/C amount from 3 to 10mg. The maximum yield of produced oligomers was achieved under 100  C, 1MPa hydrogen pressure, 1-3h, and 3-10mg Pd/C.

26059861|t|Changing composition of microbial communities indicates seepage fluid difference of the Thuwal Seeps in the Red Sea.
26059861|a|UNASSIGNED: Cold seeps are unique ecosystems that are generally characterized by high salinity and reducing solutions. Seepage fluid, the major water influx of this system, contains hypersaline water, sediment pore water, and other components. The Thuwal cold seeps were recently discovered on the continental margin of the Red Sea. Using 16S rRNA gene pyro-sequencing technology, microbial communities were investigated by comparing samples collected in 2011 and 2013. The results revealed differences in the microbial communities between the two sampling times. In particular, a significantly higher abundance of Marine Group I (MGI) Thaumarchaeota was coupled with lower salinity in 2013. In the brine pool, the dominance of Desulfobacterales in 2011 was supplanted by MGI Thaumarchaeota in 2013, perhaps due to a reduced supply of hydrogen sulfide from the seepage fluid. Collectively, this study revealed a difference in water components in this ecosystem between two sampling times. The results indicated that the seawater in this cold seep displayed a greater number of characteristics of normal seawater in 2013 than in 2011, which might represent the dominant driving force for changes in microbial community structures. This is the first study to provide a temporal comparison of the microbial biodiversity of a cold seep ecosystem in the Red Sea.

26078389|t|Life-course body mass index trajectories and blood pressure in mid life in two British birth cohorts: stronger associations in the later-born generation.
26078389|a|BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of recent increases in obesity and more rapid gains in body mass index (BMI) on cardiovascular risk factors. We investigated life-course BMI trajectories associations with adult blood pressure (BP) across two generations. METHODS: We used the the 1946 and 1958 British birth cohorts. Joint multivariate response models were fitted to longitudinal BMI measures [7, 11, 16, 20, 26, 36, 43 and 50 y (years): 1946 cohort, n   =   4787; 7, 11, 16, 23, 33 and 45 y: 1958 cohort, n   =   16 820] and mid-adult BP. We adopted linear spline models with random coefficients to characterize childhood and adult BMI slopes. RESULTS: Mean systolic BP (SBP) decreased from the earlier- to later-born cohort by 2.8   mmHg in females, not males; mean diastolic BP (DBP) decreased by 3.2-3.3   mmHg (both sexes). Adult BMI was higher in the later- than the earlier-born cohort by 1.3-1.8   kg/m(2), slopes of BMI trajectory were steeper from early adulthood and associations with adult BP were stronger. Associations between adult BMI and SBP were stronger in the later-born cohort. For males, childhood BMI slope was associated with SBP only in the later-born cohort; the association for adult BMI slope was stronger in the later-born cohort: correlation coefficient r   =   0.28 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25,0.33] versus 0.13 (0.06,0.20). For females, childhood slope was associated with SBP in both cohorts; adult slope was associated with SBP only in the 1958 cohort [r   =   0.34 (0.31,0.37)]. Patterns of child-to-adult BMI associations were similar in relation to DBP. CONCLUSIONS: BP did not increase between two generations born 12 y apart despite higher BMI levels. A stronger association between BMI trajectory and BP in the later-born cohort suggests that BMI-related effects may have been offset by improvements in other factors linked to BP, such as diet and smoking.

26078482|t|Increased Serum Interleukin-9 Levels in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Pathogenic Role or Just an Epiphenomenon?
26078482|a|The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the levels of IL-9 in patients with SLE and RA compared with controls and the association of IL-9 levels with clinical and laboratory parameters. IL-9 levels were assessed in 117 SLE patients, 67 RA patients, and 24 healthy controls by ELISA. Clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded. The IL-9 serum levels were significantly higher in RA patients (4,77    3,618   pg/mL) and in SLE patients (12,26    25,235   pg/mL) than in healthy individuals (1,22    0,706   pg/mL) (p < 0,001). In SLE patients, there were no statistically significant associations or correlations between the levels of IL-9 and SLEDAI or other clinical and laboratorial parameters, with the exception of disease time, which showed a statistically significant negative correlation with IL-9 levels (r = -0,1948;    p = 0,0378). In RA patients, no association or statistically significant correlation was observed with disease duration, DAS28, HAQ, rheumatoid factor positivity, or erosions on radiography. These data demonstrated increased serum levels of IL-9 in SLE and RA patients, but further studies are needed to clarify the precise role of this cytokine and its potential use as therapeutic target.

26076646|t|Anisotropic optical film embedded with cellulose nanowhisker.
26076646|a|We investigated anisotropic optical behaviors of composite films embedded with CNWs. To control the orientation of CNWs, elongation was applied to the composite film. Morphological and mechanical analyses of the specimens were carried out to examine the influence of the applied extension. The CNWs were found to be aligned in the elongated direction, yielding remarkable anisotropic microstructure and optical properties. As the applied elongation and CNW loading increased, the resulting degree of polarization and birefringence increased due to increased interactions between the embedded particles. This study suggests a way to prepare an anisotropic optical component with nanoparticles of which the microstructures, such as orientation and filler content, can be controlled.

26080407|t|Light-driven synchrony of Prochlorococcus growth and mortality in the subtropical Pacific gyre.
26080407|a|UNASSIGNED: Theoretical studies predict that competition for limited resources reduces biodiversity to the point of ecological instability, whereas strong predator/prey interactions enhance the number of coexisting species and limit fluctuations in abundances. In open ocean ecosystems, competition for low availability of essential nutrients results in relatively few abundant microbial species. The remarkable stability in overall cell abundance of the dominant photosynthetic cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is assumed to reflect a simple food web structure strongly controlled by grazers and/or viruses. This hypothesized link between stability and ecological interactions, however, has been difficult to test with open ocean microbes because sampling methods commonly have poor temporal and spatial resolution. Here we use continuous techniques on two different winter-time cruises to show that Prochlorococcus cell production and mortality rates are tightly synchronized to the day/night cycle across the subtropical Pacific Ocean. In warmer waters, we observed harmonic oscillations in cell production and mortality rates, with a peak in mortality rate consistently occurring    6 h after the peak in cell production. Essentially no cell mortality was observed during daylight. Our results are best explained as a synchronized two-component trophic interaction with the per-capita rates of Prochlorococcus consumption driven either directly by the day/night cycle or indirectly by Prochlorococcus cell production. Light-driven synchrony of food web dynamics in which most of the newly produced Prochlorococcus cells are consumed each night likely enforces ecosystem stability across vast expanses of the open ocean.

26077605|t|High mortality rate of unintentional poisoning due to prescription opioids in adults enrolled in Medicaid compared to those not enrolled in Medicaid in Montana.
26077605|a|BACKGROUND: Unintentional death due to prescription drug-related poisoning has been a growing problem nationally. Some sub-populations have been shown to be at higher risk than others. METHODS: In 2014, we matched death records to Medicaid eligibility files to determine enrollment status at the time of unintentional death from prescription opioid poisoning from 2003 to 2012 in Montana. Medicaid prescription claims for decedents were used to assess prescribing patterns and time between refills. RESULTS: The age-adjusted mortality rate per 100,000 from opioid poisoning for adults aged 18-64 years and enrolled in Medicaid at the time of death was eight times higher than the rate for non-Medicaid Montana adults (38.2 [95% CI (30.7-45.7)] vs. 4.7 [95% CI (4.1-5.3)]). Twenty-eight percent of unintentional poisoning deaths during this time frame were among Medicaid members. Only 33% of the Medicaid decedents had a claim for an opioid prescription during the month before their death. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that more needs to be done to address prescription opioid use in Montana. Adults enrolled in Medicaid continue to be at high risk for prescription opioid unintentional poisoning deaths. Data on prescribing practices suggest that there are opportunities to intervene and provide education on use of opioid medications for Medicaid members and prescribing providers.

26085391|t|Adjuvant Chemotherapy After Lobectomy for T1-2N0 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Are the Guidelines Supported?
26085391|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence guiding adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) use after lobectomy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is limited. This study evaluated the impact of AC use and tumor size on outcomes using a large, nationwide cancer database. METHODS: The effect of AC on long-term survival among patients who underwent lobectomy for margin-negative pathologic T1-2N0M0 NSCLC in the National Cancer Data Base from 2003 to 2006 was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The specific tumor size threshold at which AC began providing benefit was estimated with multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling. RESULTS: Overall 3,496 of 34,360 patients (10.2%) who met inclusion criteria were treated with AC, although AC use increased over time from 2003, when only 2.7% of patients with tumors less than 4 cm and 6.2% of patients with tumors of 4 cm or larger received AC. In unadjusted survival analysis, AC was associated with a significant 5-year survival benefit for patients with tumors less than 4 cm (74.3% vs 66.9%; P<.0001) and 4 cm or greater (64.8% vs 49.8%; P<.0001). In subanalyses of patients grouped by strata of 0.5-cm increments in tumor size, AC was associated with a survival advantage for tumor sizes ranging from 3.0 to 8.5 cm. CONCLUSIONS: Use of AC among patients with stage I NSCLC has increased over time but remains uncommon. The results of this study support current treatment guidelines that recommend AC use after lobectomy for stage I NSCLC tumors larger than 4 cm. These results also suggest that AC use is associated with superior survival for patients with tumors ranging from 3.0 to 8.5 cm in diameter.

26086958|t|Performance and Accuracy of Lightweight and Low-Cost GPS Data Loggers According to Antenna Positions, Fix Intervals, Habitats and Animal Movements.
26086958|a|UNASSIGNED: Recently developed low-cost Global Positioning System (GPS) data loggers are promising tools for wildlife research because of their affordability for low-budget projects and ability to simultaneously track a greater number of individuals compared with expensive built-in wildlife GPS. However, the reliability of these devices must be carefully examined because they were not developed to track wildlife. This study aimed to assess the performance and accuracy of commercially available GPS data loggers for the first time using the same methods applied to test built-in wildlife GPS. The effects of antenna position, fix interval and habitat on the fix-success rate (FSR) and location error (LE) of CatLog data loggers were investigated in stationary tests, whereas the effects of animal movements on these errors were investigated in motion tests. The units operated well and presented consistent performance and accuracy over time in stationary tests, and the FSR was good for all antenna positions and fix intervals. However, the LE was affected by the GPS antenna and fix interval. Furthermore, completely or partially obstructed habitats reduced the FSR by up to 80% in households and increased the LE. Movement across habitats had no effect on the FSR, whereas forest habitat influenced the LE. Finally, the mean FSR (0.90    0.26) and LE (15.4    10.1 m) values from low-cost GPS data loggers were comparable to those of built-in wildlife GPS collars (71.6% of fixes with LE < 10 m for motion tests), thus confirming their suitability for use in wildlife studies.

26084418|t|The Misuse of Prescription Opioids: A Threat for Europe?
26084418|a|In the the past two decades the medical use of prescription opioids (POs), in particular oxycodone, increased up to 14-fold in the U.S. and Canada. The high consumption of these pain relievers also led to non-medical use and abuse of these substances which in turn resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of PO related fatalities and opioid dependent subjects. In the U.S. POs became the second most prevalent type of abused drug (4.5 million abusers; 1.7% of the population) after marijuana (8 million abusers) with currently 1.9 million (0.7% of the population) people dependent on opioid pain relievers. Pain relief was the leading motive for non-medical use in about 40% of the cases, but about half of non-medical PO users reported non-pain relief motives only, like to get high or to relax. Since 2011, there is a decline in the use and misuse of POs and reduction in painkiller overdose deaths in the U.S. probably due to the introduction of a variety of restrictive regulations. In Europe, the medical use of POs is increasing as well, but at a much slower rate than in the U.S. Moreover, in Europe non-medical use of POs and fatal PO incidents are (still) rare. The paper highlights and discusses the differences between Europe versus U.S. and Canada in an attempt to assess the risk of a PO abuse and overdose epidemic in Europe. It is concluded that the risk in Europe seems to be rather limited but vigilance is needed.

26091934|t|Informal inter-island poultry movement in Indonesia: does it pose a risk to HPAI H5N1 transmission?
26091934|a|UNASSIGNED: Informal movement of domesticated poultry and wild birds is considered a major threat in terms of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 transmission between birds and from birds to humans. However, the risk of transmission from informal illegal poultry movement has received little attention in Indonesia where human fatalities are the highest in the world. This research investigated the illegal movement of adult poultry between the islands of Java, Bali and Lombok to determine the potential risk of HPAI H5N1 transmission. The aim was to determine known origins and destinations of poultry, estimated quantity and types of birds, people involved and the drivers of illegal movement. Transportation and handling methods and views on how to minimise illegal movement were also investigated. In-depth interviews were carried out with 71 key informants in Bali and Lombok in 2009. East Java was the main origin of poultry entering Bali, followed by Central Java and Lombok. Interviewees estimated that over 10,000 village chickens, 500 ducks and 50 fighting cocks were brought into Bali per month from all origins. However, there were significant discrepancies with quarantine records indicating that the majority of birds imported illegally are not detected. We conclude that although informal illegal movement of poultry in Indonesia poses a potentially high risk for potential HPAI H5N1 transmission if birds are infected, much can be done to increase surveillance, encourage reporting of sick birds, educate traders about the risks and provide effective quarantine within an appropriate cultural framework.

26088185|t|Intracranial Cerebral Artery Dissection of Anterior Circulation as a Cause of Convexity Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.
26088185|a|BACKGROUND: Convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH), defined as intrasulcal bleeding restricted to hemispheric convexities, has several etiologies: reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis or occlusion. However, it remains unknown whether cerebral artery dissection causes cSAH. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated patients admitted to our hospital between 2005 and 2013 with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack caused by cerebral artery dissection. Cerebral artery dissection was diagnosed by cervical or cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) showing a wall hematoma. CT angiography, ultrasonography, or intra-arterial digital-subtraction angiography detected cerebral artery dissection if a double lumen, string sign, intimal flap, or dissecting aneurysm was observed at a nonbifurcation site. We used CT or MRI to detect cSAH, which was defined as blood collection restricted to one or few cerebral sulci without extending to the basal cisterns, ventricles, or Sylvian and interhemispheric fissures. Demographic, neuroimaging, treatment, and prognostic data were collected. RESULTS: In total, 82 patients were diagnosed with ischemic stroke caused by cerebral artery dissection. The following arteries were affected: the ICA (9 patients), anterior cerebral artery (ACA; 12 patients), middle cerebral artery (MCA; 12 patients), vertebral artery (37 patients), basilar artery (5 patients), posterior cerebral artery (2 patients), and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (4 patients). In addition, 1 patient presented with simultaneous dissection in both the vertebral and internal carotid arteries, and 6 patients (7%) presented with cSAH (3 men and 3 women, age 39-67 years). The MCA was dissected in four cases and the ACA in two cases, with cSAH frequencies of 33 (4 of 12) and 17% (2 of 12), respectively, in those vessels. Artery dissection in the vertebrobasilar artery system was not responsible for cSAH (0 of 48). In all the MCA dissection cases, cSAH occurred in the arterial border zone between the ACA and MCA territories. Although 2 patients showed early reperfusion with temporary cSAH enlargement, cSAH was self-limiting. Antithrombotic treatment did not complicate the clinical course when used in 4 patients during acute or subacute phases. All patients achieved a 3-month poststroke modified Rankin Scale of 0-2. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cSAH caused by intracranial cerebral artery dissection is not rare. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the precise mechanism underlying cSAH in cerebral artery dissection.    2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

26043820|t|Enigma of HIV-1 latent infection in astrocytes: an in-vitro study using protein kinase C agonist as a latency reversing agent.
26043820|a|UNASSIGNED: Purging HIV-1 to cure the infection in patients undergoing suppressive antiretroviral therapy requires targeting all possible viral reservoirs. Other than the memory CD4(+) T cells, several other HIV-1 reservoirs have been identified. HIV-1 infection in the brain as a reservoir is well documented, but not fully characterized. There, microglia, perivascular macrophages, and astrocytes can be infected by HIV-1. HIV-1 infection in astrocytes has been described as a nonproductive and primarily a latent infection. Using primary human astrocytes, we investigated latent HIV-1 infection and tested phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C agonist, as an HIV-1-latency- reversing agent in infected astrocytes. Chloroquine (CQ) was used to facilitate initial HIV-1 escape from endosomes in astrocytes. CQ significantly increased HIV-1 infection. But treatment with PMA or viral Tat protein was similar to untreated HIV-1-infected astrocytes. Long-term follow-up of VSV-envelope-pseudotyped HIV-1 infected astrocytes showed persistent infection for 110 days, indicating the active state of the virus.

26090414|t|Swimming Activity Prevents the Unloading Induced Loss of Bone Mass, Architecture, and Strength in Rats.
26090414|a|We investigated whether swimming activity associated with a three-week period of hypoactivity could prevent the deleterious effects of disuse on the tibias of tail-suspended rats. Forty Wistar rats were divided into five groups: (HS) permanently hindlimb suspension rats; (HS + Swim) rats submitted to unloading interrupted by swimming exercise; (HS + WB) hindlimb suspension rats with interruption for regular weight bearing for the same length of time as the HS+Swim rats; (Control) control rats that were allowed regular cage activities; and (Control + Swim) control rats that underwent swimming exercise. At the end of the experiment, bone mineral density, bone strength, and trabecular quantification were analyzed. The hindlimb-suspended rats exhibited bone quality loss (significant decrease in BMD, bone strength, and deterioration of trabecular and cortical bone architecture; decrease in BV/TV, TbN, TbTh, ConnD, CtV, and CtTh; and increase in TbSp) when compared to control rats. In contrast, trained rats showed a significant increase of 43% in bone mass, 29% in bone strength, 58% in trabecular thickness, 85% in bone volume, 27% in trabeculae number, and 30% in cortical volume, when compared to the hindlimb-suspended rats. We conclude that swimming activity not only ameliorates but also fully prevents the deleterious effects on bone quality in osteopenic rats.

26080060|t|[Are Administrative Data Prognostically Relevant for Intended Disability Pension Claims and Indicators of Subjective Need for Rehabilitation?]
26080060|a|UNASSIGNED: Objectives: The aim of the study was to examine the associations of the Risk Index Disability Pension (RI-DP), which was calculated from administrative data, with intended disability pension claims and other health- and work-related characteristics. Material and methods: Insured persons of the Federal German Pension Insurance were surveyed by questionnaire in 2013. Questionnaire data were additionally linked to administrative data. The gross sample was restricted to persons, who received sick leave benefits in the previous year while not claiming or utilizing any rehabilitation services for the previous 4 years. Results: 1   261 men and 1   495 women were included in the analyses. The odds of an intended disability pension claim were 4.8-times higher in men and 3.4-times higher in women if RI-DP scores were high. Furthermore, high RI-DP scores were also associated with frequent disability days, poor self-rated work ability and frequent visits to physicians. Discussion: The associations of the RI-DP with the examined characteristics imply that administrative data could support early identification of rehabilitation needs.

26090913|t|iFR-FFR comparison in daily practice: a single-center, prospective, online assessment.
26090913|a|AIMS: To compare the performance of instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) with fractional flow reserve (FFR) in a real-life, prospective, single-center, and independent study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included and 89 angiographic intermediate lesions underwent functional evaluation with both iFR and FFR. FFR was used as the gold standard, and the patients having FFR values 0.80 or less only underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. Linear regression demonstrated close agreement between the two techniques (R=0.83, P<0.0001). Receiver operator characteristic analysis confirmed the strong correlation, with an area under the curve approximately equal to unity. iFR detected ischemia with a sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 87%, respectively, thus revealing a positive predictive value of 78% and a negative predictive value of 100%. In addition, according to FFR assessment, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed on 39 lesions (43.8%) in 27 patients (50%), whereas positive iFR values were found in 52 lesions (+14.6% compared with FFR). At clinical follow-up (ranging from 6 to 16 months), all patients remained asymptomatic and none of them experienced major adverse cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: In this independent, online, comparison of iFR-FFR values in patients with angiographic intermediate lesions, results are consistent with those derived from previous offline controlled trials, and support the correlation between iFR and FFR in daily clinical practice.

26064331|t|A proteomic study of the differential protein expression in MDBK cells after bovine herpesvirus type 1 infection (BHV-1) strain treatment.
26064331|a|Different BHV-1 strains, such as the virulent IBRV LN01/08 strains and the attenuated vaccine strain IBRV LNM, produces different clinical immune responses; however, the study of the differential protein expression in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells after BHV-1-infection still remains unclear. Here, we applied a comparative proteomic strategy, based on 2D and MALDI-TOF/MS platforms, to examine the differential expression of proteins in MDBK cells that were treated and not treated with virulent IBRV LN01/08 and attenuated IBRV LNM strains. A total of eight differential proteins, including pyruvate kinase, heat shock protein (HSP) 90 (HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1), annexin A, albumin (ALB), scinderin (SCIN), tubulin (alpha 1a) and vimentin (VIM), were identified. Among these proteins, pyruvate kinase, and HSP90 (HSP90AB1), tubulin and vimentin were identified in the virulent IBRV LN01/08 strain group, but were not identified in the attenuated IBRV LNM group. These results play an important role in tumor formation and development, cell migration, tumor cell line apoptosis, cell invasion and viral infection. The HSP90 (HSP90AA1) protein was identified in the control group and the attenuated IBRV LNM-infected group. Most studies have shown that HSP90 proteins were more of a cancer gene target, and inhibiting its function would result to oncogene degradation during cancer treatment. On the other hand, ALB is associated to cell differentiation, apoptosis, necrosis, cell death, viral infection, autophagy, interstitial tissue inflammation, and cell survival. These results provide a theoretical basis for the systematic understanding of BHV-1-infection mechanisms and BHV-1-induced immune responses.

26066647|t|Acetylcholine ameliorates endoplasmic reticulum stress in endothelial cells after hypoxia/reoxygenation via M3 AChR-AMPK signaling.
26066647|a|UNASSIGNED: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with various cardiovascular diseases. However, its pathophysiological relevance and the underlying mechanisms in the context of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in endothelial cells are not fully understood. Previous findings have suggested that acetylcholine (ACh), the major vagal nerve neurotransmitter, protected against cardiomyocyte injury by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This study investigated the role of ER stress in endothelial cells during H/R and explored the beneficial effects of ACh. Our results showed that H/R triggered ER stress and apoptosis in endothelial cells, evidenced by the elevation of glucose-regulated protein 78, cleaved caspase-12 and C/EBP homologous protein expression. ACh significantly decreased ER stress and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling positive cells and restored ER ultrastructural changes induced by H/R, possibly via protein kinase-like ER kinase and inositol-requiring kinase 1 pathways. Additionally, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide, a type-3 muscarinic ACh receptor (M3 AChR) inhibitor, abolished ACh-mediated increase in AMPK phosphorylation during H/R. Furthermore, M3 AChR or AMPK siRNA abrogated the ACh-elicited the attenuation of ER stress in endothelial cells, indicating that the salutary effects of ACh were likely mediated by M3 AChR-AMPK signaling. Overall, ACh activated AMPK through M3 AChR, thereby inhibited H/R-induced ER stress and apoptosis in endothelial cells. We have suggested for the first time that AMPK may function as an essential intermediate step between M3 AChR stimulation and inhibition of ER stress-associated apoptotic pathway during H/R, which may help to develop novel therapeutic approaches targeting ER stress to prevent or alleviate ischemia/reperfusion injury.

26067713|t|A Pathological Scoring System to Predict Renal Outcome in Diabetic Nephropathy.
26067713|a|BACKGROUND: With the association between diabetic nephropathy (DN) and renal outcome being increasingly clear, we aimed at creating a new DN pathological scoring system that could predict the renal outcome. METHODS: We studied 205 patients with DN confirmed by renal biopsy, sometime between March 1985 and January 2010, who met the inclusion criteria. Renal biopsy included clinical parameters and Tervaert classifications. Hazard ratios (HRs) for death-censored end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were estimated by adjusted Cox proportional-hazards regression. The overall pathological risk score (D-score) was calculated by summing the products of beta coefficient and bootstrap-inclusion fractions, its predictive utility evaluated by Kaplan-Meier methods and c-statistics for a 10-year risk of ESRD. RESULTS: The D-scores of glomerular classes 1, 2A, 2B, 3, and 4 were, respectively, 0, 3, 4, 6, and 6. Those of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy classes 0, 1, 2, and 3 were 0, 7, 9, and 11, and those of interstitial inflammation classes 0, 1, and 2 were 0, 3, and 4, respectively. The D-score of hyalinosis class 2 was 3 and that of arteriosclerosis class 2 was 1. So, a patient's D-score could be 0-25. HRs for ESRD in patients with D-score  <=14, 15-18, 19-21, and 22-25 were, respectively, 1.00 (reference) 16.21 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.86-140.90), 19.78 (95% CI, 2.15-182.40), and 45.46 (95% CI, 4.63-446.68) after adjusting for clinical factors. The c-statistics suggested a better predictive ability for a 10-year renal death with models that included the D-score. CONCLUSION: Prediction of DN patients' renal outcome was better with the D-score than without it. Patients with a D-score  <=14 had excellent renal prognosis.    2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

26038669|t|Antagonism at combined effects of chemical fertilizers and carbamate insecticides on the rice-field N2-fixing cyanobacterium Cylindrospermum sp. in vitro.
26038669|a|Effects of chemical fertilizers (urea, super phosphate and potash) on toxicities of two carbamate insecticides, carbaryl and carbofuran, individually to the N2-fixing cyanobacterium, Cylindrospermum sp. were studied in vitro at partially lethal levels (below highest permissive concentrations) of each insecticide. The average number of vegetative cells between two polar heterocysts was 16.3 in control cultures, while the mean value of filament length increased in the presence of chemical fertilizers, individually. Urea at the 10 ppm level was growth stimulatory and at the 50 ppm level it was growth inhibitory in control cultures, while at 100 ppm it was antagonistic, i.e. toxicity-enhancing along with carbaryl, individually to the cyanobacterium, antagonism was recorded. Urea at 50 ppm had toxicity reducing effect with carbaryl or carbofuran. At 100 and 250 ppm carbofuran levels, 50 ppm urea only had a progressive growth enhancing effect, which was marked well at 250 ppm carbofuran level, a situation of synergism. Super phosphate at the 10 ppm level only was growth promoting in control cultures, but it was antagonistic at its higher levels (50 and 100 ppm) along with both insecticides, individually. Potash (100, 200, 300 and 400 ppm) reduced toxicity due to carbaryl 20 and carbofuran 250 ppm levels, but potash was antagonistic at the other insecticide levels. The data clearly showed that the chemical fertilizers used were antagonistic with both the insecticides during toxicity to Cylindrospermum sp.

26068074|t|Hey bHLH Proteins Interact with a FBXO45 Containing SCF Ubiquitin Ligase Complex and Induce Its Translocation into the Nucleus.
26068074|a|The Hey protein family, comprising Hey1, Hey2 and HeyL in mammals, conveys Notch signals in many cell types. The helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain as well as the Orange domain, mediate homo- and heterodimerization of these transcription factors. Although distinct interaction partners have been identified so far, their physiological relevance for Hey functions is still largely unclear. Using a tandem affinity purification approach and mass spectrometry analysis we identified members of an ubiquitin E3-ligase complex consisting of FBXO45, PAM and SKP1 as novel Hey1 associated proteins. There is a direct interaction between Hey1 and FBXO45, whereas FBXO45 is needed to mediate indirect Hey1 binding to SKP1. Expression of Hey1 induces translocation of FBXO45 and PAM into the nucleus. Hey1 is a short-lived protein that is degraded by the proteasome, but there is no evidence for FBXO45-dependent ubiquitination of Hey1. On the contrary, Hey1 mediated nuclear translocation of FBXO45 and its associated ubiquitin ligase complex may extend its spectrum to additional nuclear targets triggering their ubiquitination. This suggests a novel mechanism of action for Hey bHLH factors.

26063481|t|Lapatinib sensitizes quiescent MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to doxorubicin by inhibiting the expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein-1.
26063481|a|UNASSIGNED: The quiescent state plays an important role in tumor recurrence because it protects cancer cells from chemotherapy. Previously, we optimized tumorsphere cultures for in  vitro screening methods for targeting quiescent cell population since the majority of cells in tumorspheres are quiescent. In this study, we analyzed efficacies of current chemotherapeutics in tumorsphere assays to seek better strategies for eradicating quiescent cell population. Tumorspheres generated from MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited accumulations of cells in the G0/G1 phase as compared with cells in monolayer culture, suggesting that sphere formation contributes to an increase of quiescent cells. As a result of a decreased doxorubicin uptake, MDA-MB-231 tumorspheres exhibited chemoresistance to both doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Since we found that the enhanced EGFR signaling is characteristics of MDA-MB-231 tumorspheres, the combination effects of chemotherapy with lapatinib, a dual ErbB1/ErbB2 inhibitor, were accessed in tumorsphere assays. Western blot analysis revealed that lapatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and p38 in doxorubicin-treated tumorspheres. The inhibition of EGFR signaling by the treatment with lapatinib suppressed the expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein-1 (MRP-1), leading to increased cytotoxicity of doxorubicin to tumorspheres. Furthermore, blockade of the PI3K/AKT and p38 MAPK signaling pathways resulted in a remarkable decrease in the expression of MRP-1 in doxorubicin-treated tumorspheres. These results demonstrate that lapatinib sensitizes quiescent MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to doxorubicin by inhibiting doxorubicin-induced MRP-1 expression via PI3K/AKT and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Thus, this study suggests that treatment with lapatinib in combination with anti-mitotic drugs maybe a useful approach to improve clinical response by eradicating the quiescent cancer cell population.

26065810|t|Effect of silver nanoparticles on marine organisms belonging to different trophic levels.
26065810|a|UNASSIGNED: Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) are increasingly used in a wide range of consumer products and such an extensive use raises questions about their safety and environmental toxicity. We investigated the potential toxicity of Ag-NPs in the marine ecosystem by analyzing the effects on several organisms belonging to different trophic levels. Algae (Dunaliella tertiolecta, Skeletonema costatum), cnidaria (Aurelia aurita jellyfish), crustaceans (Amphibalanus amphitrite and Artemia salina) and echinoderms (Paracentrotus lividus) were exposed to Ag-NPs and different end-points were evaluated: algal growth, ephyra jellyfish immobilization and frequency of pulsations, crustaceans mortality and swimming behavior, and sea urchin sperm motility. Results showed that all the end-points were able to underline a dose-dependent effect. Jellyfish were the most sensitive species, followed by barnacles, sea urchins, green algae, diatoms and brine shrimps. In conclusion, Ag-NPs exposure can influence different trophic levels within the marine ecosystem.

26080476|t|PROTECTION EFFICACY AND MODES OF ACTION OF TWO RESISTANCE INDUCERS ON WHEAT AGAINST SEPTORIA TRITICI BLOTCH.
26080476|a|Septoria tritici blotch caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola is one of the most devastating foliar diseases of wheat. Disease control relies heavily on fungicides, but frequent development of fungal resistance and the negative impact of their extensive use on the environment and human health increasingly compromise this control strategy. Plant resistance inducers could be an alternative to conventional fungicides to control in a more durable manner this pathogen. Here, we tested in the greenhouse two resistance inducers (FSOV7 and FSOV10) on two wheat cultivars, Alixan (susceptible) and Altigo (resistant), against M. graminicola. FSOV7 conferred a significant protection level on both cultivars, while FSOV10 conferred a significant protection level on the resistant cv. Altigo only. Furthermore, the modes of action of the two inducers were examined using cytological, biochemical and molecular approaches. In planta, investigation of the infection process showed that FSOV10 significantly reduced fungal spore germination, whereas FSOV7 did not. An association of protection efficacy with a decrease of fungal biomass and fungal b-1, 4-endoxylanase and protease activities was observed in both cultivars. However, no association of plant peroxidase activity with protection efficacy was recorded, whatever the cultivar and the resistance inducer. A RT-qPCR assay revealed significant inductions of the expression of genes involved in different defence pathways; further statistical analyses should determine which genes are associated with the observed protection efficacies. This study showed significant inducer-cultivar interactions on wheat against M. graminicola and allowed us to investigate the modes of action on wheat of the two studied resistance inducers.

26069945|t|Incidence of Tuberculosis Among Young Children in Rural Mozambique.
26069945|a|BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) contributes significantly to child morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to estimate the minimum community-based incidence rate of TB among children <3 years of age in Southern Mozambique. METHODS: Between October 2011 and October 2012, in the Manhi  a District Health and Demographic Surveillance System, we enrolled prospectively all presumptive TB cases younger than 3 years of age through passive and active case finding. Participants included all children who were either symptomatic or were close contacts of a notified adult smear-positive pulmonary TB. Children were clinically evaluated at baseline and follow-up visits. Investigation for TB disease included chest radiography, HIV and tuberculin skin testing as well as gastric aspirate and induced sputum sampling, which were processed for smear, culture and mycobacterial molecular identification. RESULTS: During the study period, 13,764 children <3 years contributed to a total of 9575 person-year. Out of the 789 presumptive TB cases enrolled, 13 had TB culture confirmation and 32 were probable TB cases. The minimum community-based incidence rate of TB (confirmed plus probable cases) was 470 of 100,000 person-year (95% confidence interval: 343-629 of 100,000). HIV co-infection was present in 44% of the TB cases. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the huge burden of pediatric TB.

26065788|t|Enhancing and Customizing Laboratory Information Systems to Improve/Enhance Pathologist Workflow.
26065788|a|UNASSIGNED: Optimizing pathologist workflow can be difficult because it is affected by many variables. Surgical pathologists must complete many tasks that culminate in a final pathology report. Several software systems can be used to enhance/improve pathologist workflow. These include voice recognition software, pre-sign-out quality assurance, image utilization, and computerized provider order entry. Recent changes in the diagnostic coding and the more prominent role of centralized electronic health records represent potential areas for increased ways to enhance/improve the workflow for surgical pathologists. Additional unforeseen changes to the pathologist workflow may accompany the introduction of whole-slide imaging technology to the routine diagnostic work.

26069440|t|Genetic improvement for root growth angle to enhance crop production.
26069440|a|The root system is an essential organ for taking up water and nutrients and anchoring shoots to the ground. On the other hand, the root system has rarely been regarded as breeding target, possibly because it is more laborious and time-consuming to evaluate roots (which require excavation) in a large number of plants than aboveground tissues. The root growth angle (RGA), which determines the direction of root elongation in the soil, affects the area in which roots capture water and nutrients. In this review, we describe the significance of RGA as a potential trait to improve crop production, and the physiological and molecular mechanisms that regulate RGA. We discuss the prospects for breeding to improve RGA based on current knowledge of quantitative trait loci for RGA in rice.

26064953|t|The Impact of Vitamin D 3 Supplementation on Mechanisms of Cell Calcium Signaling in Chronic Kidney Disease.
26064953|a|Intracellular calcium concentration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is significantly increased, and the regulatory mechanisms maintaining cellular calcium homeostasis are impaired. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of vitamin D3 on predominant regulatory mechanisms of cell calcium homeostasis. The study involved 16 CKD stages 2-3 patients with vitamin D deficiency treated with cholecalciferol 7000-14000   IU/week for 6 months. The regulatory mechanisms of calcium signaling were studied in PBMCs and red blood cells. After vitamin D3 supplementation, serum concentration of 25(OH)D3 increased (P < 0.001) and [Ca(2+)]i decreased (P < 0.001). The differences in [Ca(2+)]i were inversely related to differences in 25(OH)D3 concentration (P < 0.01). Vitamin D3 supplementation decreased the calcium entry through calcium release activated calcium (CRAC) channels and purinergic P2X7 channels. The function of P2X7 receptors was changed in comparison with their baseline status, and the expression of these receptors was reduced. There was no effect of vitamin D3 on P2X7 pores and activity of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPases. Vitamin D3 supplementation had a beneficial effect on [Ca(2+)]i decreasing calcium entry via CRAC and P2X7 channels and reducing P2X7 receptors expression.

26059135|t|Immunoreactivity reduction of soybean meal by fermentation, effect on amino acid composition and antigenicity of commercial soy products.
26059135|a|Food allergy has become a public health problem that continues to challenge both the consumer and the food industry. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the reduction of immunoreactivity by natural and induced fermentation of soybean meal (SBM) with Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Saccharomyces cereviseae, and to assess the effect on amino acid concentration. Immunoreactivity of commercially available fermented soybean products and ingredients was also evaluated. ELISA and western blot were used to measure IgE immunoreactivity using plasma from soy sensitive individuals. Commercial soy products included tempeh, miso and yogurt. Fermented SBM showed reduced immunoreactivity to human plasma, particularly if proteins were <20kDa. S. cereviseae and naturally fermented SBM showed the highest reduction in IgE immunoreactivity, up to 89% and 88%, respectively, against human pooled plasma. When SBM was subjected to fermentation with different microorganisms, most of the total amino acids increased significantly (p<0.05) and only few of them suffered a decrease depending on the type of fermentation. All commercial soy containing products tested showed very low immunoreactivity. Thus, fermentation can decrease soy immunoreactivity and can be optimized to develop nutritious hypoallergenic soy products. However, the clinical relevance of these findings needs to be determined by human challenge studies.

26071513|t|Adjusting Treatment for an Inmate-Patient Receiving Medication Involuntarily.
26071513|a|Correctional psychiatrists can pursue authorization for forcible medication of pretrial detainees housed in a federal prison hospital through two pathways: an administrative process based upon the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Washington v. Harper and a judicial process founded on the Court's ruling in Sell v. United States. The pathway associated with Harper pertains to the involuntary treatment of a mentally ill inmate believed to be dangerous or gravely disabled, or both, to protect the inmate-patient and others from harm, whereas the avenue linked with Sell involves the forcible treatment of an incompetent pretrial defendant to restore competence to stand trial. Given the difference in objectives between these two processes, there is rarely confusion regarding which pathway the correctional psychiatrist should pursue. However, circumstances can arise that blur the distinction between the Harper and Sell processes. I present a composite case highlighting such a scenario and provide discussion and commentary to assist the correctional psychiatrist in deciding on the most appropriate course of action.

26063214|t|TLR3 gene polymorphisms in cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
26063214|a|INTRODUCTION: Recent studies examining the association of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) gene polymorphisms with the risk of developing various types of cancer have reported conflicting results. Clarifying this association could advance our knowledge of the influence of TLR3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on cancer risk. METHODS: We systematically reviewed studies that focused on a collection of 12 SNPs located in the TLR3 gene and the details by which these SNPs influenced cancer risk. Additionally, 14 case-control studies comprising a total of 7997 cases of cancer and 8699 controls were included in a meta-analysis of 4 highly studied SNPs (rs3775290, rs3775291, rs3775292, and rs5743312). RESULTS: The variant TLR3 genotype rs5743312 (C9948T, intron 3, C   >   T) was significantly associated with an increased cancer risk as compared with the wild-type allele (odds ratio [OR]   =   1.11, 95  % confidence interval [CI]   =   1.00-1.24, P   =   0.047). No such association was observed with other TLR3 SNPs. In the stratified analysis, the rs3775290 (C13766T, C   >   T) variant genotype was found to be significantly associated with an increased cancer risk in Asian populations. Additionally, the rs3775291 (G13909A, G   >   A) variant genotype was significantly associated with an increased cancer risk in Asians, subgroup with hospital-based controls, and subgroup with a small sample size. CONCLUSION: After data integration, our findings suggest that the TLR3 rs5743312 polymorphism may contribute to an increased cancer risk.

26067996|t|Regulation of autophagy by the nuclear factor kB signaling pathway in the hippocampus of rats with sepsis.
26067996|a|BACKGROUND: Sepsis with brain dysfunction has contributed to an increase risk of morbidity and mortality. In its pathophysiology, both autophagy and nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) have been suggested to play important roles. Based on the fact that crosstalk between autophagy and NF-kB, two stress-response signaling pathways, has been detected in other pathophysiological processes, this study was undertaken to explore the process of autophagy in the hippocampus of septic rats and the role NF-kB plays in the regulation of autophagy during the process. METHODS: Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or a sham operation was conducted on male Wistar rats. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an inhibitor of the NF-kB signaling pathway, or a vehicle control, was used to treat with the rats 2  h before the CLP operation. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and biological signal recording was used to measure the morphological and physiological signs of hippocampal dysfunction. An electron microscope was used to observe autophagosome formation and lysosome activation in the hippocampus after CLP. Western blotting and immune histochemistry were used to detect the hippocampus levels of NF-kB and essential proteins involved in formation of the autophagosome (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), Beclin1, Lamp-1, and Rab7). RESULTS: Compared with sham-operated rats, the CLP rats showed decreasing mean arterial pressure (MAP), increasing heart rate (HR), and pathological histological changes. CLP rats exhibited not only increased vacuolization through electron micrographs but also increased LC3-II, decreased Beclin1, LAMP-1, and Rab7 through the immunofluorescence and Western blot. However, PDTC   +   CLP rats revealed that inhibition of the NF-kB signal axis by PDTC increased the levels of LC3-II, Beclin1, LAMP-1, and Rab7 and improved physiological function including blood pressure and heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: The autophagy process during the hippocampus of CLP rats might be blocked by the activation of NF-kB signaling pathway. Inhibition of NF-kB signaling pathway could enhance the completion of autophagy with a neuroprotective function in septic brains.

26056643|t|Evaluation of Effectiveness of Ethanolic Extract of Artemisia aucheri, Individually and in Combination with Chloroquine, on Chloroquine - Sensitive Strain of Plasmodium berghei in Sourian Mice.
26056643|a|BACKGROUND: Drug resistance in malaria parasites is extending in the world particularly in chemical synthesized drugs such as 4- aminoquinolines and aminoalcoholes. Employing herbal extracts is encouraged by WHO in the malarious areas. In this study, the effectiveness of ethanolic extract of Artemisia aucheri individually and in combination with chloroquine, has been considered against chloroquine - sensitive strain of Plasmodium berghei. METHODS: At the first stage, ED50 of A. aucheri and chloroquine on P. berghei was calculated using in vivo test. Then based on the ED50s combination of A. aucheri and chloroquine with ratios of 0/100,10/90,20/80,30/70,40/60,50/50,60/40,70/30,80/20,90/10 and100/0 were tested against the parasite. For evaluating the adverse effect of A. aucheri on the mice, for two weeks 1000mg/kg of the extract was daily employed and the mice were followed up for fifty days. RESULTS: ED50s for chloroquine and A. aucheri were 1.6mg/kg and 1000mg/kg respectively. The outcome of two drugs combination on the mice showed antagonistic effects on the chloroquine - sensitive strain of parasite. Two weeks daily administration of A. aucheri had no toxic effect on the mice. CONCLUSION: A. aucheri individually can be effective in reducing the parasite while in combination with chloroquine loses its property.

26029554|t|Benefit of a second opinion: From metastatic disease to resectable lung cancer with sarcoid-like reaction.
26029554|a|BACKGROUND: Mediastinal lymphadenopathy in combination with lung cancer is suggestive for lymph node metastases but can also have other origins. CASE REPORT: We describe a patient diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer presenting with parenchymal lesions and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. A second opinion including FDG-PET scan review and a mediastinoscopy followed by surgery revealed tumor specimens originating from a single primary tumor with a sarcoid-like reaction in the mediastinal lymph nodes, changing the diagnosis from metastasized to resectable lung cancer. DISCUSSION: PET positive lesions are not always synonymous with metastatic disease in the presence of a malignant tumor. Conscientious review of FDG-PET scans and tissue sampling are therefore mandatory to determine definitive staging and subsequent interventions.

26064040|t|Powerful Tukey's One Degree-of-Freedom Test for Detecting Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment Interactions.
26064040|a|Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) robustly associated with hundreds of complex human diseases including cancers. However, the large number of GWAS-identified genetic loci only explains a small proportion of the disease heritability. This "missing heritability" problem has been partly attributed to the yet-to-be-identified gene-gene (G * G) and gene-environment (G * E) interactions. In spite of the important roles of G * G and G * E interactions in understanding disease mechanisms and filling in the missing heritability, straightforward GWAS scanning for such interactions has very limited statistical power, leading to few successes. Here we propose a two-step statistical approach to test G * G/G * E interactions: the first step is to perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the multiple SNPs within a gene region, and the second step is to perform Tukey's one degree-of-freedom (1-df) test on the leading PCs. We derive a score test that is computationally fast and numerically stable for the proposed Tukey's 1-df interaction test. Using extensive simulations we show that the proposed approach, which combines the two parsimonious models, namely, the PCA and Tukey's 1-df form of interaction, outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the utility and efficiency gains of the proposed method with applications to testing G * G interactions for Crohn's disease using the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) GWAS data and testing G * E interaction using data from a case-control study of pancreatic cancer.

26064624|t|'Neanderthal bone flutes': simply products of Ice Age spotted hyena scavenging activities on cave bear cubs in European cave bear dens.
26064624|a|Punctured extinct cave bear femora were misidentified in southeastern Europe (Hungary/Slovenia) as 'Palaeolithic bone flutes' and the 'oldest Neanderthal instruments'. These are not instruments, nor human made, but products of the most important cave bear scavengers of Europe, hyenas. Late Middle to Late Pleistocene (Mousterian to Gravettian) Ice Age spotted hyenas of Europe occupied mainly cave entrances as dens (communal/cub raising den types), but went deeper for scavenging into cave bear dens, or used in a few cases branches/diagonal shafts (i.e. prey storage den type). In most of those dens, about 20% of adult to 80% of bear cub remains have large carnivore damage. Hyenas left bones in repeating similar tooth mark and crush damage stages, demonstrating a butchering/bone cracking strategy. The femora of subadult cave bears are intermediate in damage patterns, compared to the adult ones, which were fully crushed to pieces. Hyenas produced round-oval puncture marks in cub femora only by the bone-crushing premolar teeth of both upper and lower jaw. The punctures/tooth impact marks are often present on both sides of the shaft of cave bear cub femora and are simply a result of non-breakage of the slightly calcified shaft compacta. All stages of femur puncturing to crushing are demonstrated herein, especially on a large cave bear population from a German cave bear den.

26111401|t|H    Tracking Control of Completely Unknown Continuous-Time Systems via Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning.
26111401|a|UNASSIGNED: This paper deals with the design of an H    tracking controller for nonlinear continuous-time systems with completely unknown dynamics. A general bounded L   -gain tracking problem with a discounted performance function is introduced for the H    tracking. A tracking Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaac (HJI) equation is then developed that gives a Nash equilibrium solution to the associated min-max optimization problem. A rigorous analysis of bounded L   -gain and stability of the control solution obtained by solving the tracking HJI equation is provided. An upper-bound is found for the discount factor to assure local asymptotic stability of the tracking error dynamics. An off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm is used to learn the solution to the tracking HJI equation online without requiring any knowledge of the system dynamics. Convergence of the proposed algorithm to the solution to the tracking HJI equation is shown. Simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

26109688|t|Relationship between low response to clopidogrel and periprocedural ischemic events with coil embolization for intracranial aneurysms.
26109688|a|OBJECTIVES: Low response to antiplatelet drugs is one of the risk factors for ischemic events. We examined the influence of low response to clopidogrel on symptomatic ischemic events and new ischemic MRI lesions with endovascular intracranial aneurysmal coil embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between August 2010 and July 2013, 189 procedures in 181 consecutive patients who underwent endovascular coiling and received clopidogrel before treatment were investigated retrospectively. Platelet aggregation activity was examined by VerifyNow analysis. Low response to clopidogrel was defined as P2Y12 reaction units >= 230 in this study. Symptomatic ischemic complications within 30   days and postoperative new ischemic lesions on MRI-diffusion weighted imaging were evaluated. RESULTS: 66 of 189 (34.9%) cases were low responders to clopidogrel. Ischemic complications occurred in 2 of 66 (3.0%) low responders compared with 6 of 123 (4.9%) responders (p=0.72). A new high intensity spot larger than 5   mm was significantly more frequent in low responders (26 of 66; 39.4%) than in responders (26 of 121; 21.2%; p=0.01). On multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for larger new ischemic lesions were low response to clopidogrel, smokers, posterior location, and aneurysms with a larger neck. CONCLUSIONS: Low response to clopidogrel had little effect on clinical outcome although it increased asymptomatic large ischemic lesions in this cohort.

26105258|t|OS044. Morphological differences in murine placenta detected by magneticresonance imaging measurements of T2 relaxation times in mouse models ofpreeclampsia.
26105258|a|INTRODUCTION: We have demonstrated that morphologically distinct regions of the murine placenta can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with image contrast arising from the variation in T2 relaxation times between regions and dependent upon blood flow. Previous studies of human placenta by other groups have shown a homogeneous tissue with correlation of relaxation times with gestational age and a trend for shorter relaxation times in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. The ability to detect morphological changes and alterations in blood flow in experimental models of preeclampsia would be a significant boost in understanding the relationship between abnormal placental implantation, reduced placental perfusion, inflammatory cytokines, angiogenic molecules and other factors that may play a role in the syndrome. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether morphological changes or abnormalities can be detected by T2 mapping in the placenta of mice subject to two experimental models of preeclampsia (reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) model and TNF-a induced model). METHODS: Pregnant C57BL/6JArc mice were, on day 13.5 of gestation, either subject to a unilateral ligation of the right uterine artery (RUPP) (n=2) or given an infusion of TNF-a by subcutaneous insertion of a mini-osmotic pump primed to deliver 500ng/kg/day for 4days (n=2). Controls were normal pregnant (n=2), sham-operated (n=1) or saline infused animals(n=1). MRI images were acquired on anaesthetised mice on day 17.5 of gestation using a Bruker Avance 11.7 Tesla wide-bore spectrometer with micro-imaging probe capable of generating gradients of 0.45T/m. T2 measurements were acquired using an MSME sequence protocol (Bruker MSME-T2-map) with an in-plane resolution of 0.1-0.2mm. Matlab was used to generate R2 (i.e.,1/T2) maps from the acquired data with the T2 values being calculated from selected regions of interest from 2-6 individual placenta from each mouse. RESULTS: Differences in the pattern of the regions of T2 contrast in the placenta were observed between normal, TNF-a treated and RUPP mice. The ratio of T2 values from the inner two regions was also significantly altered in TNF-a treated 1.98  0.09 (p=0.007); RUPP 1.94  0.11 (p=0.006) compared to normal animals 2.5  0.1 . CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that morphological differences or abnormalities can be detected by T2 mapping in the placenta of mice subject to experimental models of preeclampsia and may be used to analyse changes quantitatively. This technology has the potential to be used when studying the dynamic changes in the placenta of pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia.

26103684|t|Examination of Growth Hormone (GH) Gene Polymorphism and its Association with Body Weight and Selected Body Dimensions in Ducks.
26103684|a|The main objective of the study was to assess the polymorphism in intron 2 of the GH gene and its association with some morphological traits (body weight--BW, length of trunk with neck--LTN, length of trunk--LT, chest girth--CG, length of breast bone--LBB, length of shank--LS). Polymorphism in intron 2 of the GH gene was evaluated for four duck populations (Pekin ducks AF51, Muscovy ducks from a CK and CRAMMLCFF mother and Mulard ducks). Genetic polymorphism was determined with the PCR-RFLP method using the BsmFI restriction enzyme. In the studied duck sample two alleles (GH(C) and GH(T)) and three genotypes (GH/TT, GH/CT, GH/CC) were found at locus GH/BsmFI. In both groups of Muscovies and in Mulards the dominant allele was GH(T). On the contrary in Pekin ducks AF51, the frequency of both alleles was found to be similar. The most frequent genotype in the examined ducks was GH/TT. In Pekin ducks AF51 three genotypes were observed, while in Mulard ducks and in male Muscovy ducks from a mother marked as CK, two genotypes (GH/TT and GH/CT) were identified. Muscovy duck females from a CK mother and all males and females of Muscovy duck from a CRAMMLCFF mother were monomorphic with only the GH/TTgenotype detected. The results showed that males of Pekin duck AF51 with the GH/TT genotype were characterized by higher (P < 0.01) BW value than those with the GH/CC and GH/CTgenotype. In females of Pekin ducks AF51, this same trend was observed; individuals with GH/TT genotype were superior (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) to birds with two other detected genotypes in respect to BW, CG, LBB and LS. In the case of Mulards, ducks with the GH/TT genotype were distinguished by higher values of all evaluated traits compared to ducks with GH/CT and GH/CC genotypes, however most of the recorded differences were not significant. The only trait markedly impacted (P < 0.05) by the polymorphism of the GH gene intron 2 was the LS value in males.

26079661|t|Clinical and cost effectiveness of enhanced oral healthcare in stroke care settings (SOCLE II): A pilot, stepped wedge, cluster randomized, controlled trial protocol.
26079661|a|RATIONALE: Stroke-associated pneumonia, a leading cause of hospital-acquired infection after stroke, affects a fifth of stroke survivors annually. Associated with increased risk of death and poorer rehabilitation outcomes, research suggests a possible relationship between stroke-associated pneumonia and patients' oral health. AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial of the clinical and cost effectiveness of enhanced oral healthcare vs. usual oral healthcare for people in stroke care settings. DESIGN: Our pilot, multicentered, pragmatic, stepped wedge, cluster randomized controlled trial oral healthcare [Stroke Oral healthCare pLan Evaluation (SOCLE II)] will compare enhanced oral healthcare intervention and usual oral healthcare. Over 13 months, across 4 wards, we seek to recruit 400 patients (estimating an average of 23 beds per site and a 50% recruitment rate) and 60 nursing staff (estimating an average of 20 members of staff per site and a 75% recruitment rate). Initially, control data (usual oral healthcare) will be collected from all sites. In a randomized, stepped manner, wards will convert to deliver the enhanced oral healthcare intervention. STUDY OUTCOME(S): Outcomes will be captured across dimensions of care (as recommended for evaluations of complex interventions) at baseline and weekly thereafter. Primary outcomes are pneumonia (patients), knowledge and attitudes (staff), and specialist dental referrals (service). Secondary outcomes include oral health quality of life, plaque, antibiotics, length of stay, death (patients), use of oral healthcare equipment and products, completed assessments, and documented oral healthcare plans (staff). DISCUSSION: As one of the first stepped wedge, cluster randomized, controlled trials in stroke care mapping of the complex intervention, our choice of primary and secondary outcomes and choice of trial design are described.

26082278|t|Nematicidal Activity of the Volatilome of Eruca sativa on Meloidogyne incognita.
26082278|a|UNASSIGNED: Research on new pesticides based on plant extracts, aimed at the development of nontoxic formulates, has recently gained increased interest. This study investigated the use of the volatilome of rucola (Eruca sativa) as a powerful natural nematicidal agent against the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita. Analysis of the composition of the volatilome, using GC-MS-SPME, showed that the compound (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate was the most abundant, followed by (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol and erucin, with relative percentages of 22.7    1.6, 15.9    2.3, and 8.6    1.3, respectively. Testing of the nematicidal activity of rucola volatile compounds revealed that erucin, pentyl isothiocyanate, hexyl isothiocyanate, (E)-2-hexenal, 2-ethylfuran, and methyl thiocyanate were the most active with EC50 values of 3.2    1.7, 11.1    5.0, 11.3    2.6, 15.0    3.3, 16.0    5.0, and 18.1    0.6 mg/L, respectively, after 24 h of incubation. Moreover, the nematicidal activity of fresh rucola used as soil amendant in a containerized culture of tomato decreased the nematode infection in a dose-response manner (EC50 = 20.03 mg/g) and plant growth was improved. On the basis of these results, E. sativa can be considered as a promising companion plant in intercropping strategies for tomato growers to control root-knot nematodes.

26114265|t|Analysis of suspended solids transport processes in primary settling tanks.
26114265|a|UNASSIGNED: The paper shows the results of a long-term research comprising FLUENT-based numerical modeling, in situ measurements and laboratory tests to analyze suspended solids (SS) transport processes in primary settling tanks (PSTs). The investigated PST was one of the rectangular horizontal flow PSTs at a large municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of a capacity of 500,000 population equivalent. Many middle-sized and large WWTPs are equipped with such PSTs. The numerical PST model was calibrated and validated based on the results of comprehensive in situ flow and SS concentration measurements from low (5 m/h) up to quite high surface overflow rates of 9.5 and 13.0 m/h and on settling and other laboratory tests. The calibrated and validated PST model was also successfully used for evaluation of some slight modifications of the inlet geometry (removing lamellas, installing a flocculation 'box', shifting the inlet into a 'bottom-near' or into a 'high' position), which largely affect PST behavior and performance. The investigations provided detailed insight into the flow and SS transport processes within the investigated PST, which strongly contributes to hydrodynamically driven design and upgrading of PSTs.

26057857|t|PLGA nanoparticles prepared by nano-emulsion templating using low-energy methods as efficient nanocarriers for drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier.
26057857|a|UNASSIGNED: Neurodegenerative diseases have an increased prevalence and incidence nowadays, mainly due to aging of the population. In addition, current treatments lack efficacy, mostly due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that limits the penetration of the drugs to the central nervous system. Therefore, novel drug delivery systems are required. Polymeric nanoparticles have been reported to be appropriate for this purpose. Specifically, the use of poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) seems to be advantageous due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability that ensure safe therapies. In this work, a novel approximation to develop loperamide-loaded nanoparticles is presented: their preparation by nano-emulsion templating using a low-energy method (the phase inversion composition, PIC, method). This nano-emulsification approach is a simple and very versatile technology, which allows a precise size control and it can be performed at mild process conditions. Drug-loaded PLGA nanoparticles were obtained using safe components by solvent evaporation of template nano-emulsions. Characterization of PLGA nanoparticles was performed, together with the study of the BBB crossing. The in vivo results of measuring the analgesic effect using the hot-plate test evidenced that the designed PLGA loperamide-loaded nanoparticles are able to efficiently cross the BBB, with high crossing efficiencies when their surface is functionalized with an active targeting moiety (a monoclonal antibody against the transferrin receptor). These results, together with the nanoparticle characterization performed here are expected to provide sufficient evidences to end up to clinical trials in the near future.

26113052|t|Dissemination of clonally related multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in Ireland.
26113052|a|UNASSIGNED: In October 2012, an outbreak of gentamicin-resistant, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae occurred in a neonatal intensive care unit in Ireland. In order to determine whether the outbreak strain was more widely dispersed in the country, 137 isolates of K. pneumoniae with this resistance phenotype collected from 17 hospitals throughout Ireland between January 2011 and July 2013 were examined. ESBL production was confirmed phenotypically and all isolates were screened for susceptibility to 19 antimicrobial agents and for the presence of genes encoding bla TEM, bla SHV, bla OXA, and bla CTX-M; 22 isolates were also screened for bla KPC, bla NDM, bla VIM, bla IMP and bla OXA-48 genes. All isolates harboured bla SHV and bla CTX-M and were resistant to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefpodoxime; 15 were resistant to ertapenem, seven to meropenem and five isolates were confirmed as carbapenemase producers. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of all isolates identified 16 major clusters, with two clusters comprising 61% of the entire collection. Multilocus sequence typing of a subset of these isolates identified a novel type, ST1236, a single locus variant of ST48. Data suggest that two major clonal groups, ST1236/ST48 (CG43) and ST15/ST14 (CG15) have been circulating in Ireland since at least January 2011.

26008717|t|Influence of polyphenols from lingonberry, cranberry, and red grape on in vitro digestibility of rice.
26008717|a|UNASSIGNED: Dietary polyphenols are abundant antioxidants in the human diet and are associated with lower rates of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This study aims to determine the effects of cooking white rice (WR) added with lingonberry (WRLB), cranberry (WRCB), and red grape (WRRG) on in vitro digestibility. There was significantly lower level of glucose release for WRRG compared with WR (p   <   0.05). WRLB and WRCB showed no effect on glucose release compared with WR (p   >   0.05). Increasing concentrations of red grape polyphenol decreased digestibility of white rice (p   <   0.05). A positive correlation between the red grape phenolic content and the resistant starch was observed (R   =   0.9854). Red grape polyphenol had the greatest impact on reducing in vitro digestibility of white rice. The addition of polyphenols in carbohydrate-rich foods may be a practical means to reduce the high glycemic response of rice eaten around the world.

26010862|t|The association between fibrinogen reactivity to mental stress and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T in healthy adults.
26010862|a|BACKGROUND: Plasma fibrinogen is considered as a positive mediator between mental stress and cardiovascular disease because it is an acute-phase protein released in response to mental stress and a coagulation factor. However those three factors have never been studied together within a single integrated framework, using cardiac troponin T as a marker of cardiovascular risk. METHODS: 491 disease-free men and women aged 53-76 were tested for fibrinogen levels before, immediately after, and following recovery from standardized mental stress tasks. We measured plasma cardiac troponin T using a high-sensitivity assay (HS-CTnT) and coronary calcification using electron-beam dual-source computed tomography. RESULTS: The average fibrinogen concentration increased by 5.1% (s.d.=7.3) in response to stress and then tended to return to baseline values. People with higher baseline fibrinogen values had smaller increases (blunted responses) following the stress task (P=0.001), and people with higher stress responses showed better recovery (P<0.001). In unadjusted analyses, higher baseline fibrinogen was associated with higher chances of having detectable HS-CTnT (P=0.072) but, conversely, higher fibrinogen response was associated with lower chances of having detectable HS-CTnT (P=0.007). The adjustment for clinical, inflammatory, and haemostatic factors, as well as for coronary calcification eliminated the effect of baseline fibrinogen, whereas the negative association between fibrinogen response and HS-CTnT remained robust: the odds of detectable HS-CTnT halved for each 10% increase in fibrinogen concentration due to stress (OR=0.49, P=0.007, 95% CI=0.30-0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Greater fibrinogen responses to mental stress are associated with lower likelihood of detectable high-sensitivity troponin T plasma concentration. A more dynamic fibrinogen response appears to be advantageous for cardiovascular health.

26010134|t|Up to 100% Improvement in Dynamic Nuclear Polarization Solid-State NMR Sensitivity Enhancement of Polymers by Removing Oxygen.
26010134|a|UNASSIGNED: High-field dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) has emerged as a powerful technique for improving the sensitivity of solid-state NMR (SSNMR), yielding significant sensitivity enhancements for a variety of samples, including polymers. Overall, depending upon the type of polymer, the molecular weight, and the DNP sample preparation method, sensitivity enhancements between 5 and 40 have been reported. These promising enhancements remain, however, far from the theoretical maximum (>1000). Crucial to the success of DNP SSNMR is the DNP signal enhancement (  DNP ), which is the ratio of the NMR signal intensities with and without DNP. It is shown here that, for polymers exhibiting high affinity toward molecular oxygen (e.g., polystyrene), removing part of the absorbed (paramagnetic) oxygen from the solid-state samples available as powders (instead of dissolved or dispersed in a solvent) increases proton nuclear relaxation times and   DNP , hereby providing up to a two-fold sensitivity increase (i.e., a four-fold reduction in experimental time).

26013132|t|Environmental determinants on the assemblage structure of drosophilidae flies in a temperate-subtropical region.
26013132|a|The species composition and the relative abundance of species in an insect community can vary in time and space for many reasons, including climatic variables and habitat preferences. Drosophilids were collected each quarter from April 2011 to April 2012 (five collections in all) in a natural area of the Pampa biome, considering three environments: open field, forest edge and the interior of forest patches. Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests were used to examine the effects of temporal and spatial components on the drosophilid assemblage. Four diversity measures: S obs , S rar , H' and E var were used to evaluate the community structure. A total of 7164 drosophilids belonging to 51 species were collected. The interaction of species in each environment varied among sampling periods. The abundance of both Neotropical and exotic species was affected by temporal and spatial components. The species of the D. repleta group were predominantly more abundant in the open field, but they migrated to the forest patches during periods of thermal stress. Generally, diversity was greatest in the interior of forest patches. Nevertheless, temporal components appear to be the predominant environmental determinant of the characteristics of the drosophilid community of the Pampas. Furthermore, the forest patches appear to act as a center of recolonization, reinforcing their importance in the maintenance of biodiversity in the Pampas; this function will be even more important in the future, when the temperatures will, most likely, be higher.

26010879|t|Secondary anchor targeted cell release.
26010879|a|UNASSIGNED: Personalized medicine offers the promise of tailoring therapy to patients, based on their cellular biomarkers. To achieve this goal, cellular profiling systems are needed that can quickly and efficiently isolate specific cell types without disrupting cellular biomarkers. Here we describe the development of a unique platform that facilitates gentle cell capture via a secondary, surface-anchoring moiety and cell release. The cellular capture system consists of a glass surface functionalized with APTES, d-desthiobiotin and streptavidin. Biotinylated mCD11b and hIgG antibodies are used to capture mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7) and human breast cancer (MCF7-GFP) cell lines, respectively. The surface functionalization is optimized by altering assay components, such as streptavidin, d-desthiobiotin and APTES, to achieve cell capture on 80% of the functionalized surface and cell release upon biotin treatment. We also demonstrate an ability to capture 50% of target cells within a dual-cell mixture. This engineering advancement is a critical step towards achieving cell isolation platforms for personalized medicine. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

26017589|t|Effects of nitroglycerin ointment on mastectomy flap necrosis in immediate breast reconstruction: a randomized controlled trial.
26017589|a|BACKGROUND: Mastectomy flap necrosis is a common complication of immediate breast reconstruction that impacts recovery time and reconstructive success. Nitroglycerin ointment is a topical vasodilator that has been shown to improve skin flap survival in an animal model. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the application of nitroglycerin ointment to the breast skin after mastectomy and immediate reconstruction causes a decrease in the rate of mastectomy flap necrosis compared with placebo. METHODS: This study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial and included patients aged 21 to 69 years undergoing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction at the University of British Columbia-affiliated hospitals (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Patients with a medical history that precluded the administration of nitroglycerin were excluded from the study. The target sample size was 400 patients. Nitroglycerin ointment (45 mg) or a placebo was applied to the mastectomy skin at the time of surgical dressing. RESULTS: The trial was stopped at the first interim analysis after 165 patients had been randomized (85 to the treatment group and 80 to the placebo group). Mastectomy flap necrosis developed in 27 patients (33.8 percent) receiving placebo and in 13 patients (15.3 percent) receiving nitroglycerin ointment; the between-group difference was 18.5 percent (p = 0.006; 95 percent CI, 5.3 to 31.0 percent). Postoperative complications were similar in both groups [nitroglycerin, 22.4 percent (19 of 85); placebo, 28.8 percent (23 of 80)]. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction, there was a marked reduction in mastectomy flap necrosis in patients who received nitroglycerin ointment. Nitroglycerin ointment application is a simple, safe, and effective way to help prevent mastectomy flap necrosis. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, I.

26018667|t|Indanes-Properties, Preparation, and Presence in Ligands for G Protein Coupled Receptors.
26018667|a|UNASSIGNED: The indane (2,3-dihydro-1H-indene) ring system is an attractive scaffold for biologically active compounds due to the combination of aromatic and aliphatic properties fused together in one rigid system. This bicyclic structure provides a wide range of possibilities to incorporate specific substituents in different directionalities, thus being an attractive scaffold for medicinal chemists. Notably, many indane-based compounds are being used in the clinic to treat various diseases, such as indinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor; indantadol, a potent Monoamine Oxidase (MAO)-inhibitor; the amine uptake inhibitor indatraline; and the ultra-long-acting b-adrenoceptor agonist indacaterol. Given the diversity of targets these drugs act on, one could argue that the indane ring system is a privileged substructure. In the present review, the synthetic and medicinal chemistry of the indane ring system is described. In more detail, it contains a comprehensive overview of compounds bearing the indane substructure with G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activity, with particular emphasis on their structure-activity relationships (SAR).

26019423|t|Comparison of high-resolution sonography and electrophysiology in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.
26019423|a|BACKGROUND: The diagnostic accuracy of high-resolution ultrasonography (HRUS) in comparison to electro-diagnostic testing (EDX) in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is debatable. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of HRUS with EDX in patients with various grades of CTS and CTS associated with peripheral neuropathy (CTS + PNP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort of 57 patients with possible CTS was studied along with matched controls. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve at the inlet of carpal tunnel was assessed by a sonologist blinded to the clinical and EDX data. Palm wrist distal sensory latency difference (PWDSLD), second lumbrical-interosseus distal motor latency difference (2LIDMLD) and CSA were compared in patients with different grades of severity of CTS and CTS+PNP. RESULTS: Total 92 hands of 57 patients met the clinical criteria for CTS. Mean CSA at the inlet of carpal tunnel was 0.11    0.0275 cm(2). It had the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values of 76.43%, 72.72%, 89.47% and 68%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Overall, HRUS had good correlation with PWDSLD and 2LIDMLD electro-diagnostic studies in all grades of CTS and CTS + PNP. CONCLUSION: HRUS can be used as a complementary screening tool to EDX. However, EDX has been found to be more sensitive and specific in mild CTS.

26017277|t|Lower Cambrian polychaete from China sheds light on early annelid evolution.
26017277|a|UNASSIGNED: We herein report a fossilized polychaete annelid, Guanshanchaeta felicia gen. et sp. nov., from the Lower Cambrian Guanshan Biota (Cambrian Series 2, stage 4). The new taxon has a generalized polychaete morphology, with biramous parapodia (most of which preserve the evidence of chaetae), an inferred prostomium bearing a pair of appendages, and a bifid pygidium. G. felicia is the first unequivocal annelid reported from the Lower Cambrian of China. It represents one of the oldest annelids among those from other early Paleozoic Lagerst  tten including Sirius Passet from Greenland (Vinther et al., Nature 451: 185-188, 2011) and Emu Bay from Kangaroo island (Parry et al., Palaeontology 57: 1091-1103, 2014), and adds to our increasing roll of present-day animal phyla recognized in the early Cambrian Guanshan Biota. This finding expands the panorama of the Cambrian 'explosion' exemplified by the Guanshan Biota, suggesting the presence of many more fossil annelids in the Chengjiang Lagerst  tte and the Kaili Biota. In addition, this new taxon increases our knowledge of early polychaete morphology, which suggests that polychaete annelids considerably diversified in the Cambrian.

26118587|t|Self-management support for chronic pain in primary care: a cross-sectional study of patient experiences and nursing roles.
26118587|a|AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe chronic pain self-management from the perspective of individuals living with chronic pain in the context of primary care nursing. BACKGROUND: Self-management is a key chronic pain treatment modality and support for self-managing chronic pain is mainly provided in the context of primary care. Although nurses are optimally suited to facilitate self-management in primary care, there is a need to explore opportunities for optimizing their roles. DESIGN: Two cross-sectional studies. METHODS: The Chronic Pain Self-Management Survey was conducted in 2011-2012 to explore the epidemiology and self-management of chronic pain in Canadian adults. The questionnaire was distributed to 1504 individuals in Ontario. In 2011, the Primary Care Nursing Roles Survey was distributed to 1911 primary care nurses in Ontario to explore their roles and to determine the extent to which chronic disease management strategies, including support for self-management, were implemented in primary care. RESULTS: Few respondents to the pain survey identified nurses as being the 'most helpful' facilitator of self-management while physicians were most commonly cited. Seventy-six per cent of respondents used medication to manage their chronic pain. Few respondents to the nursing survey worked in practices with specific programmes for individuals with chronic pain. Individuals with chronic pain identified barriers and facilitators to self-managing their pain and nurses identified barriers and facilitators to optimizing their role in primary care. CONCLUSION: There are several opportunities for primary care practices to facilitate self-management of chronic pain, including the optimization of the primary care nursing role.

26098729|t|Blocking Opioids Attenuates Physical Warmth-Induced Feelings of Social Connection.
26098729|a|UNASSIGNED: "Heartwarming" social experiences, when one feels interpersonally connected to others, have recently been linked with physical warmth. According to one theory (Panksepp, 1998), "social warmth" and physical warmth may be closely linked because both experiences are supported by similar neurobiological mechanisms; however, the neurochemical substrates underlying this overlap have not been explored. Here, an opioid antagonist, naltrexone, was administered in order to examine the role of opioids, previously shown to alter temperature and social bonding behavior, on perceived thermal intensity, general positive affect, and feelings of social connection from physical warmth. Thirty-one participants took both naltrexone and a placebo and completed a temperature manipulation task (held a warm pack, cold pack, and neutral object) while on each drug. Replicating previous research, holding a warm (vs. a cold or neutral) object increased feelings of social connection. Moreover, blocking opioids reduced this effect. Hence, naltrexone specifically reduced feelings of social connection to holding a warm (vs. neutral) object but not to holding a cold (vs. neutral) object. These results lend further support to the theory that social and physical warmth share neurobiological, opioid receptor dependent mechanisms. (PsycINFO Database Record

26121522|t|A comparison between general rheumatologists and scleroderma experts with respect to following systemic sclerosis guidelines.
26121522|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine if there are differences between expert and non-expert rheumatologists in systemic sclerosis (SSc) management. METHODS: Information relating to demographics, complications, investigations, and treatment of SSc patients was obtained from an online survey to members of the Canadian Rheumatology Association (CRA), and selected chart audits. Results were compared to data from a SSc database ('experts', Canadian Scleroderma Research Group - CSRG). RESULTS: The online survey (61/300 respondents; 20% response rate) found that most agreed with the EULAR SSc guidelines. Some exceptions were only 47% said they ordered annual echocardiograms and 45% pulmonary function tests. Chart audits of 70 SSc patients from 7 community rheumatology practices revealed no significant differences in their treatment from SSc guidelines, but some investigations differed compared to the CSRG. There was site variability among community practices relating to investigations, and treatment. Patients receiving an echocardiogram within the previous year varied from 10-90%, and PA pressure was reported in 30-100% of SSc patients among sites. Overall, 91% of SSc patients on chart audit had ever received an echocardiogram, but in 30% of cases there was no PA pressure recorded vs. only 19% in CSRG (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to SSc experts, general rheumatologists did not differ in their practices for many SSc guidelines despite the fact that they do not see many SSc patients when compared to SSc experts, but there was site variability. An apparent difference is that although echocardiograms are being ordered, PA pressures are missing which could lead to late detection of PAH.

26118509|t|Accuracy of the Fonseca anamnestic index in the identification of myogenous temporomandibular disorder in female community cases.
26118509|a|The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of the Fonseca anamnestic index (FAI) in the identification of myogenous temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Two hundred and three female volunteers participated in this study, 117 with myogenous TMD and 86 without TMD. The Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders were first applied as the gold standard for the diagnosis. The volunteers then answered the 10 items on the FAI, which furnished a score ranging from 0 to 100 points. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to determine the accuracy of the diagnosis (area under the curve) and the best cutoff point of the tool. Thus, FAI demonstrated a high degree of accuracy for the diagnosis of myogenous TMD (area under the ROC curve of 0.940). The best cutoff point was a score of 47.50. Thus, a score ranging from 0 to 45 points corresponds to the absence of myogenous TMD and scores ranging from 50 to 100 points identifies individuals with the disorder. In conclusion, the high degree of diagnostic accuracy demonstrates that the FAI can be employed for the identification of myogenous TMD in female community cases.

26075470|t|Paradoxical Seizure Response to Phenytoin in an Epileptic Heroin Addict.
26075470|a|BACKGROUND: Phenytoin has a narrow therapeutic window and seizures can occur at both ends of the spectrum. CASE REPORT: A 41-year-old man with a history of a seizure disorder and heroin addiction presented with dizziness following 2 generalized tonic-clonic seizures that occurred earlier that day. The patient had received a loading dose of phenytoin for seizures associated with a subtherapeutic level 5 days previously. Initial evaluation revealed an elevated phenytoin level of 32.6 mcg/mL and an opiate-positive toxicology screen. Levetiracetam was started on the day of presentation and phenytoin was held until the level returned to the therapeutic range. The patient's dizziness resolved and he had no additional seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation for reversible causes of seizure activity along with anticonvulsant administration is generally the standard of care for breakthrough seizures. Phenytoin blood levels, if supratherapeutic, may be at least partially responsible for breakthrough seizure activity; in this circumstance, holding phenytoin and temporarily adding another anticonvulsant may be indicated.

26036813|t|MANAGEMENT OF ENDOCRINE DISEASE: Paediatric Cushing's disease.
26036813|a|UNASSIGNED: Cushing's disease (CD) is the commonest form of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome and is a rare clinical diagnosis in paediatric and adolescent patients. CD is caused by an ACTH-secreting pituitary corticotroph adenoma and is associated with significant morbidity in children; therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are critical for optimal therapeutic outcome. This review highlights the key clinical and biochemical features of paediatric CD and appraises current practices in diagnosis and management. A close liaison with adult endocrinology colleagues, particularly, for interpretation of investigations and definition of therapeutic strategy is strongly advised.

26038052|t|Is augmentation plating an effective treatment for non-union of femoral shaft fractures with nail in situ?
26038052|a|PURPOSE: There are few reports of non-union femur shaft fractures treated with plate fixation with the nail in situ. This study reports our results in 40 cases. METHODS: Retrospective series of non-union and delayed union of femoral shaft after intramedullary nailing treated with plate fixation. Patients were serially followed-up till 12  months. Fracture union, time to union, knee range of motion, deformity, shortening and complications were recorded. Descriptive statistics were performed as applicable. RESULTS: There were 40 patients with mean age of 35  years (18-65). There were 14 cases of hypertrophic non-union, 24 cases of atrophic non-union and 2 cases of delayed union. The average time of surgery was 1     h and average blood loss was 300  ml. Exchange nailing was done in 9 cases. Union was achieved in 39 patients. The mean time to fracture union was 4  months. Post-operative knee range of motion was >120   in 35 patients. One patient developed deep infection which was treated with removal of implants and exchange nailing with a vancomycin coated nail and union was achieved. CONCLUSION: Plating is an effective treatment for non-union of diaphyseal femur fractures after intramedullary fixation with the nail in situ.

26031776|t|KRAS discordance between primary and recurrent tumors after radical resection of colorectal cancers.
26031776|a|BACKGROUND: Although KRAS shows high concordance between primary and metastatic colorectal cancers, recent studies have reported discordance and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. To evaluate KRAS concordance between primary colorectal cancers and recurrent tumors after radical resection, we performed this study. METHODS: Between January 2007 and August 2013, among patients underwent radical resection for primary colorectal cancers and tissue sampling of recurred tumors including resection or biopsy, 74 patients whose both primary and recurred tumor tissues were available for KRAS analysis were enrolled. The clinical and pathologic data were retrospectively revised and KRAS analyses were performed. RESULTS: The patients with initial M1 stage showed significantly higher KRAS discordance rate (54.5%). The KRAS concordance rate was 79.7% (n   =   59). Forty-two patients (56.8%) showed the wild-to-wild type and 17 (22.9%) showed the mutant-to-mutant type. The discordance rate was 20.3% (n   =   15). Eight patients (10.8%) showed the wild-to-mutant type, and 7 (9.5%) showed the mutant-to-wild type. Among 15 discordance cases, intra-tumoral heterogeneity was found in 26.7% (n   =   4). CONCLUSIONS: There is 20.3% KRAS discordance between primary and recurrent tumors, which is higher rate than is generally known. For selection of the effective target agent, KRAS analysis of recurred tumors will be necessary, if it is available. J. Surg. Oncol. 2015 111:1059-1064.    2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

26115032|a|BACKGROUND: Acute hydrogen sulfide (H2S) poisoning produces a coma, the outcome of which ranges from full recovery to severe neurological deficits. The aim of our study was to 1- describe the immediate and long-term neurological effects following H2S-induced coma in un-anesthetized rats, and 2- determine the potential benefit of methylene blue (MB), a compound we previously found to counteract acute sulfide cardiac toxicity. METHODS: NaHS was administered IP in un-sedated rats to produce a coma (n = 34). One minute into coma, the rats received MB (4 mg/kg IV) or saline. The surviving rats were followed clinically and assigned to Morris water maze (MWM) and open field testing then sacrificed at day 7. RESULTS: Sixty percent of the non-treated comatose rats died by pulseless electrical activity. Nine percent recovered with neurological deficits requiring euthanasia, their brain examination revealed major neuronal necrosis of the superficial and middle layers of the cerebral cortex and the posterior thalamus, with variable necrosis of the caudate putamen, but no lesions of the hippocampus or the cerebellum, in contrast to the typical distribution of post-ischemic lesions. The remaining animals displayed, on average, a significantly less effective search strategy than the control rats (n = 21) during MWM testing. Meanwhile, 75% of rats that received MB survived and could perform the MWM test (P<0.05 vs non-treated animals). The treated animals displayed a significantly higher occurrence of spatial search than the non-treated animals. However, a similar proportion of cortical necrosis was observed in both groups, with a milder clinical presentation following MB. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in rats surviving H2S induced coma, spatial search patterns were used less frequently than in control animals. A small percentage of rats presented necrotic neuronal lesions, which distribution differed from post-ischemic lesions. MB dramatically improved the immediate survival and spatial search strategy in the surviving rats.

26111790|t|Mapping Power Law Distributions in Digital Health Social Networks: Methods, Interpretations, and Practical Implications.
26111790|a|BACKGROUND: Social networks are common in digital health. A new stream of research is beginning to investigate the mechanisms of digital health social networks (DHSNs), how they are structured, how they function, and how their growth can be nurtured and managed. DHSNs increase in value when additional content is added, and the structure of networks may resemble the characteristics of power laws. Power laws are contrary to traditional Gaussian averages in that they demonstrate correlated phenomena. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to investigate whether the distribution frequency in four DHSNs can be characterized as following a power law. A second objective is to describe the method used to determine the comparison. METHODS: Data from four DHSNs-Alcohol Help Center (AHC), Depression Center (DC), Panic Center (PC), and Stop Smoking Center (SSC)-were compared to power law distributions. To assist future researchers and managers, the 5-step methodology used to analyze and compare datasets is described. RESULTS: All four DHSNs were found to have right-skewed distributions, indicating the data were not normally distributed. When power trend lines were added to each frequency distribution, R(2) values indicated that, to a very high degree, the variance in post frequencies can be explained by actor rank (AHC .962, DC .975, PC .969, SSC .95). Spearman correlations provided further indication of the strength and statistical significance of the relationship (AHC .987. DC .967, PC .983, SSC .993, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate power distributions across multiple DHSNs, each addressing a unique condition. Results indicate that despite vast differences in theme, content, and length of existence, DHSNs follow properties of power laws. The structure of DHSNs is important as it gives insight to researchers and managers into the nature and mechanisms of network functionality. The 5-step process undertaken to compare actor contribution patterns can be replicated in networks that are managed by other organizations, and we conjecture that patterns observed in this study could be found in other DHSNs. Future research should analyze network growth over time and examine the characteristics and survival rates of superusers.

26048258|t|Modeling auditory coding: from sound to spikes.
26048258|a|UNASSIGNED: Models are valuable tools to assess how deeply we understand complex systems: only if we are able to replicate the output of a system based on the function of its subcomponents can we assume that we have probably grasped its principles of operation. On the other hand, discrepancies between model results and measurements reveal gaps in our current knowledge, which can in turn be targeted by matched experiments. Models of the auditory periphery have improved greatly during the last decades, and account for many phenomena observed in experiments. While the cochlea is only partly accessible in experiments, models can extrapolate its behavior without gap from base to apex and with arbitrary input signals. With models we can for example evaluate speech coding with large speech databases, which is not possible experimentally, and models have been tuned to replicate features of the human hearing organ, for which practically no invasive electrophysiological measurements are available. Auditory models have become instrumental in evaluating models of neuronal sound processing in the auditory brainstem and even at higher levels, where they are used to provide realistic input, and finally, models can be used to illustrate how such a complicated system as the inner ear works by visualizing its responses. The big advantage there is that intermediate steps in various domains (mechanical, electrical, and chemical) are available, such that a consistent picture of the evolvement of its output can be drawn. However, it must be kept in mind that no model is able to replicate all physiological characteristics (yet) and therefore it is critical to choose the most appropriate model-or models-for every research question. To facilitate this task, this paper not only reviews three recent auditory models, it also introduces a framework that allows researchers to easily switch between models. It also provides uniform evaluation and visualization scripts, which allow for direct comparisons between models.

26048988|t|Dopamine Transporter Activity Is Modulated by a-synuclein.
26048988|a|UNASSIGNED: The duration and strength of the dopaminergic signal is regulated by the dopamine transporter (DAT). Drug addiction, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases have all been associated with altered DAT activity. The membrane localization and the activity of DAT are regulated by a number of intracellular proteins. a-synuclein, a protein partner of DAT, is implicated in neurodegenerative disease and drug addiction. Little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of the interaction between DAT and a-synuclein, the cellular location of this interaction, and the functional consequences of this interaction on the basal, amphetamine (AMPH) induced DAT-meditated DA efflux and membrane microdomain distribution of the transporter. Here, we found that the majority of DAT/a-synuclein protein complexes are found at the plasma membrane of dopaminergic neurons or mammalian cells, and that AMPH-mediated increase in DAT activity enhances the association of these proteins at the plasma membrane. Further examination of the interaction of DAT and a-synuclein revealed a transient interaction between these two proteins at the plasma membrane. Additionally, we found DAT-induced membrane depolarization enhances plasma membrane localization of a-synuclein, which in turn increases DA efflux and enhances DAT localization in cholesterol rich membrane microdomains.

26099933|t|Maternal ambient air pollution exposure preconception and during early gestation and offspring congenital orofacial defects.
26099933|a|BACKGROUND: Maternal air pollution exposure has been related to orofacial clefts but the literature is equivocal. Potential chronic preconception effects have not been studied. OBJECTIVES: Criteria air pollutant exposure during three months preconception and gestational weeks 3-8 was studied in relation to orofacial defects. METHODS: Among 188,102 live births and fetal deaths from the Consortium on Safe Labor (2002-2008), 63 had isolated cleft palate (CP) and 159 had isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL   CP). Exposures were estimated using a modified Community Multiscale Air Quality model. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations adjusted for site/region and maternal demographic, lifestyle and clinical factors calculated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI per interquartile increase in each pollutant. RESULTS: Preconception, carbon monoxide (CO; OR=2.24; CI: 1.21, 4.16) and particulate matter (PM)  <=10  m (OR=1.72; CI: 1.12, 2.66) were significantly associated with CP, while sulfur dioxide (SO2) was associated with CL   CP (OR=1.93; CI: 1.16, 3.21). During gestational weeks 3-8, CO remained a significant risk for CP (OR=2.74; CI: 1.62, 4.62) and nitrogen oxides (NOx; OR=3.64; CI: 1.73, 7.66) and PM  <=2.5  m (PM2.5; OR=1.74; CI: 1.15, 2.64) were also related to the risk. Analyses by individual week revealed that positive associations of NOx and PM2.5 with CP were most prominent from weeks 3-6 and 3-5, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to several criteria air pollutants preconception and during early gestation was associated with elevated odds for CP, while CL   CP was only associated with preconception SO2 exposure.

26100861|t|Association between FOXE1 and non-syndromic orofacial clefts in a northeastern Chinese population.
26100861|a|UNASSIGNED: Non-syndromic orofacial clefts are among the most common congenital defects, and several reports have shown that the FOXE1 gene has strong associations with them. To find out if the gene was a risk factor we used a case-control and family-based analysis, and recruited 230 patients with non-syndromic oral clefts including 179 with non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and 51 with non-syndromic cleft palate alone, their parents (166 mothers and 161 fathers, including 135 complete trios), and 180 healthy controls. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were used to genotype the 2 most strongly associated markers (rs4460498 and rs3758249) in FOXE1, and case-control and family-based associations were analysed. In the case-control analyses we found a significant association with non-syndromic cleft lip and palate in rs4460498 (p=0.009) and rs3758249 (p=0.014), but no association in patients with cleft palate alone. For rs4460498 in FOXE1, the odds ratio (OR) for cases with CC homozygotes compared with TC+CC genotypes was 1.813 (95% CI 1.176 to 2.796), and for rs3758249 in FOXE1, the OR for cases with GG homozygotes compared with those with AG+AA genotypes was 0.561 (95%CI 0.371 to 0.848). The results of transmission-disequilibrium tests for rs4460698 and rs3758249 for non-syndromic orofacial clefts were p=0.003, OR=2.781 (95% CI 1.414 to 5.469) and p=0.001, OR=2.552 (95%CI 1.574 to 4.138), respectively. This suggests that FOXE1 (rs4460498 and rs3758249) is strongly associated with non-syndromic cleft lip and palate in populations in northeast China, and further study between FOXE1 and non-syndromic orofacial clefts is necessary.

26103160|t|Differentiation of Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Into Insulin-Producing Clusters by MicroRNA-7.
26103160|a|OBJECTIVES: Diabetes results from inadequate insulin production from pancreatic b-cells. Islet cell replacement is an effective approach for diabetes treatment; however, it is not sufficient for all diabetic patients. Thus, finding a new source with effective maturation of b-cells is the major goal of many studies. MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding ribonucleic acid that regulate gene expression through posttranscriptional mechanisms. MicroRNA-7 has high expression level during pancreatic islet development in humans, thereby playing a critical role in pancreatic b-cell function. We study aimed to develop a protocol to differentiate human-induced pluripotent stem cells efficiently into isletlike cell clusters in vitro by using microRNA-7. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human-induced pluripotent stem cell colonies were transfected with hsa-microRNA-7 by using siPORT NeoFX transfection agent. Total ribonucleic acid was extracted 24 and 48 hours after transfection. The expression of transcription factors which were important during pancreases development was also performed. On the third day, the potency of the clusters was assessed in response to high glucose levels. Diphenylthiocarbazone was used to identify the existence of the b-cells. The presence of insulin and Neurogenin-3 proteins was investigated by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Morphologic changes were observed on the first day after chemical transfection, and cell clusters were formed on the third day. The expression of pancreatic specific transcription factors was increased on the first day and significantly increased on the second day. The isletlike cell clusters were positive for insulin and Neurogenin-3 proteins in immunocytochemistry. The clusters were stained with Diphenylthiocarbazone and secreted insulin in a glucose challenge test. CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNA-7 transcription factor network is important in pancreatic endocrine differentiation. Chemical transfection with microRNA-7 can differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells into functional isletlike cell clusters in a short time.

26102408|t|Antitumoral Effect of Mural Cells Assessed With High-Resolution MRI and Fluorescence Microscopy.
26102408|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to detect labeled mural cells in vivo and study their therapeutic effect on tumor growth and on functional changes in the vascular network by use of MRI and fibered confocal fluorescence microscopy (FCFM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight mice were allocated to the following three groups 7 days after injection of TC1 tumor cells (C157 black 6): control, no injection (n = 7); sham, injection of phosphate-buffered saline solution (n = 10); and treated, injection of human mural cells (n = 11). Tumor growth was measured with calipers. Labeled mural cells were tracked with high-resolution MRI and FCFM. Microvessel density was assessed with MRI and FCFM, and the findings were compared with the histologic results. RESULTS: Tumor growth was significantly slowed in the treated group starting on day 10 (p = 0.001). Round signal-intensity voids were observed in the center of six of seven tumors treated with magnetically labeled mural cells. Positive staining for iron was observed in histologic sections of two of five of these tumors. Microvessel density measured with FCFM was greater in the treated mice (p = 0.03). Flow cytometry revealed viable human mural cells only in treated tumors. CONCLUSION: In this study, imaging techniques such as high-resolution MRI and FCFM showed the therapeutic effect of mural cell injection on tumor growth and microvessel function.

26101001|t|Expanded Outcomes Framework for Effective CME - The Way Forward for Pakistan.
26101001|a|Continuing Medical Education (CME) providers recognize the importance to plan educational activities that focus to improving and assessing knowledge, competency and performance outcomes rather than on attendance and satisfaction. This perspective proposes using an expanded outcomes framework for planning and assessing CME. The expanded outcomes framework supports backward planning, that starts with the population health outcomes (level 7) and moves backward, to providing continuing education for physicians that may result in improved outcomes. We the authors recognize the complexity of this framework, the recently evolved CME system in Pakistan, and the limited resources; and therefore, we suggest that planning and assessment should begin at level 3, physician knowledge. Thus, be mindful of the end and the scope of this framework that is associated and leads toward the improvement of population health outcomes.

26117816|t|Tea consumption in pregnancy as a predictor of pesticide exposure and adverse birth outcomes: The MIREC Study.
26117816|a|INTRODUCTION: Pesticide residues in tea may contribute to exposure during pregnancy; however, the impact on maternal and infant health is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether tea intake in the first trimester was associated with elevated concentrations of various pesticides in maternal blood or urine. Further, we examined the relationship between tea consumption and adverse birth outcomes. METHODS: Data from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, a pan-Canada pregnancy cohort, were used. All singleton, live births (n=1898) with available biomarkers were included in the analyses. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the population. The geometric means (GM) of organochlorine (OC) pesticide constituents or metabolites in maternal plasma (lipid adjusted) and organophosphate (OP) pesticide metabolites (adjusted for specific gravity) in maternal urine were calculated for participants who drank regular, green or herbal tea in the first trimester and for those who did not. Differences between groups were examined using chi-square or t-tests. Associations between frequency of drinking tea and adverse birth outcomes were examined using logistic regression (preterm birth and small-for-gestational-age) or generalized linear models (birthweight decile and head circumference). RESULTS: The GM of the OC pesticide constituent trans-nonachlor was 2.74mg/g lipid, and for metabolites oxychlordane and p,p'-DDE this was 1.94ng/g lipid and 55.8ng/g lipid, respectively. OP pesticide metabolite concentrations adjusted for specific gravity, were dimethylphosphate (GM: 3.19  g/L), dimethylthiophosphate (GM: 3.29  g/L), dimethyldithiophosphate (GM: 0.48  g/L), diethlphosphate (GM: 2.46), and diethylthiophosphate (GM: 0.67  g/L). There was no significant difference in mean concentrations for these OC or OP pesticide constituents or metabolites between tea drinkers - of any type - and non-tea drinkers. Further, no association was found between tea intake and adverse birth outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Pesticide concentrations did not differ by tea intake. Further, tea intake in the first trimester was not associated with adverse birth outcomes. In this study population, there was no evidence for concern about tea intake being a source of the OP or OC pesticide metabolites measured or adversely affecting birth outcomes; however, tea intake was lower than national Canadian data for women of reproductive age.

26003529|t|Attenuation of hearing loss in DBA/2J mice by anti-apoptotic treatment.
26003529|a|UNASSIGNED: DBA/2J mice are characterized by early onset hearing loss at about 3-4 weeks of age. Mutations in cadherin 23 (Cdh23) and fascin-2 (Fscn2) are responsible for the phenotypes, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In the present study, DBA/2J mice displayed progressive hair cell loss and degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) after 2 weeks of age; however, the mRNA level of Caspase-3 in the inner ears was much higher at 2 weeks of age than that at 4 or 8 weeks of age. Moreover, transcriptional levels of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 in the inner ears of DBA/2J mice were significantly higher than those of C57BL/6J mice at 2 or 8 weeks of age. Immunohistochemistry localized Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 mainly to the hair cells, SGNs and stria vascularis of the cochleae. To determine the significance of caspase-dependent apoptosis in the hearing loss, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK was given intraperitoneally to DBA/J2 mice over an 8-week period starting at one week of age. Blockage of caspases preserved hearing in the mice by more than 10  dB (dB) sound pressure level (SPL) of the ABR thresholds and significantly reduced outer hair cell loss at the basal turns of the cochleae. These results demonstrate that apoptosis in the cochleae of DBA/J2 mice contributes to the early onset of hearing loss, which can be attenuated by anti-apoptotic treatment.

26117192|t|Phosphorus dendrimers and photodynamic therapy. Spectroscopic studies on two dendrimer-photosensitizer complexes: Cationic phosphorus dendrimer with rose bengal and anionic phosphorus dendrimer with methylene blue.
26117192|a|UNASSIGNED: Dendrimers due to their unique architecture may play an important role in drug delivery systems including chemotherapy, gene therapy and recently, photodynamic therapy as well. We investigated two dendrimer-photosensitizer systems in context of potential use of these systems in photodynamic therapy. The mixtures of an anionic phosphorus dendrimer of the second generation and methylene blue were studied by UV-vis spectroscopy while that of a cationic phosphorus dendrimer (third generation) and rose bengal were investigated by spectrofluorimetric methods. Spectroscopic analysis of these two systems revealed the formation of dendrimer-photosensitizer complexes via electrostatic interactions as well as    stacking. The stoichiometry of the rose bengal-cationic dendrimer complex was estimated to be 7:1 and 9:1 for the methylene blue-anionic dendrimer complex. The results suggest that these polyanionic or polycationic phosphorus dendrimers can be promising candidates as carriers in photodynamic therapy.

26115870|t|Ginsenoside-Rg1 induces angiogenesis by the inverse regulation of MET tyrosine kinase receptor expression through miR-23a.
26115870|a|UNASSIGNED: Therapeutic angiogenesis has been implicated in ischemic diseases and wound healing. Ginsenoside-Rg1 (Rg1), one of the most abundant active components of ginseng, has been demonstrated as an angiogenesis-stimulating compound in different models. There is increasing evidence implicating microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of non-coding RNAs, as important regulators of angiogenesis, but the role of microRNAs in Rg1-induced angiogenesis has not been fully explored. In this report, we found that stimulating endothelial cells with Rg1 could reduce miR-23a expression. In silico experiments predicted hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET), a well-established mediator of angiogenesis, as the target of miR-23a. Transfection of the miR-23a precursor or inhibitor oligonucleotides validated the inverse relationship of miR-23a and MET expression. Luciferase reporter assays further confirmed the interaction between miR-23a and the MET mRNA 3'-UTR. Intriguingly, ginsensoside-Rg1 was found to increase MET protein expression in a time-dependent manner. We further demonstrated that ginsenoside-Rg1-induced angiogenic activities were indeed mediated through the down-regulation of miR-23a and subsequent up-regulation of MET protein expression, as confirmed by gain- and loss-of-function angiogenic experiments. In summary, our results demonstrated that ginsenoside-Rg1 could induce angiogenesis by the inverse regulation of MET tyrosine kinase receptor expression through miR-23a. This study has broadened our understanding of the non-genomic effects of ginsenoside-Rg1, and provided molecular evidence that warrant further development of natural compound as novel angiogenesis-promoting therapy.

26117479|t|A study on assessment of symptoms and functionality in DOTS cured patients in two districts of Garhwal, Uttarakhand.
26117479|a|BACKGROUND: In 2013, an estimated 9.0 million people developed TB and 1.5 million died from the disease. India has achieved the target of a case detection rate of 70% and a cure rate of 85% through the nationwide Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) strategy. Tuberculosis may generate residual lesions in the course of its pathology, which impair the functionality of the patient even after achieving "cure" or "treatment completion". AIMS: To assess the presence of symptoms and functionality of tuberculosis patients who had completed the treatment or had been declared as cured under Revised National Tuberculosis Programme (RNTCP). METHODS: The present study was a cross sectional study. It was conducted in the two Tuberculosis Units (TUs) of Rudraprayag and Pauri in Garhwal region of Uttarakhand among the people who had completed treatment under DOTS or had been declared as cured under RNTCP in last one year. RESULTS: Even at the completion of the treatment about 37% had cough, 25% had expectoration, 6% had hemoptysis, more than 50% had chest pain and 65% had breathlessness. The mean distance walked by the participants in six minutes was 363.5      58.2  m with a range of 245-490  m. CONCLUSIONS: The persistence of symptoms indicate that the functionality of DOTS cured patients remains compromised even after days and months of treatment completion, thereby necessitating measures for the improvement of the overall health of the patients rather than just the microbiological cure.

26117099|t|Lagrangian coherent structures along atmospheric rivers.
26117099|a|UNASSIGNED: We show that filamentous Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) over the Northern Atlantic Ocean are closely linked to attracting Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) in the large scale wind field. The detected LCSs represent lines of attraction in the evolving flow with a significant impact on all passive tracers. Using Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents, we extract LCSs from a two-dimensional flow derived from water vapor flux of atmospheric reanalysis data and compare them to the three-dimensional LCS obtained from the wind flow. We correlate the typical filamentous water vapor patterns of ARs with LCSs and find that LCSs bound the filaments on the back side. Passive advective transport of water vapor in the AR from tropical latitudes is potentially possible.

26101674|t|Bilateral Adrenal Incidentalomas: A Rare Presentation of Lung Cancer.
26101674|a|Adrenal incidentalomas are found incidentally during a radiologic examination performed for indications other than an adrenal disease, and 15% of them are bilateral adrenal masses. This study describes a 51-year-old male smoker patient admitted with diabetes mellitus. An abdominal ultrasonography performed due to his anemia revealed bilateral adrenal masses. His chest X-ray showed abnormal 10   cm opacity at the right upper lung, and brain, thorax, and abdomen CT scans showed multiple lesions compatible with lung cancer metastases. The pathological examination of the transthoracic lung biopsy specimen was consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. Findings in this patient indicate that, in middle aged patients with bilateral adrenal mass and a history or finding of any malignancy, the first diagnosis which should be considered is adrenal metastasis, and confirming the diagnosis by adrenal biopsy may be useless. Furthermore, screening all smoking patients by chest X-ray or thoracic CT for lung cancer may not be accepted as a routine procedure, but in smokers admitted to a hospital due to signs and symptoms attributed to a pulmonary disease, at least a chest X-ray should be requested.

26099968|t|Trastuzumab in combination with docetaxel/cisplatin/S-1 (DCS) for patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer: feasibility and preliminary efficacy.
26099968|a|PURPOSE: We previously reported that a triplet combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and S-1 (DCS) is active against metastatic gastric cancer with a very high response rate of 87.1  % in a phase II study. Recently, the efficacy of trastuzumab (T-mab) for the treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancer has been reported. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of DCS  +  T-mab (DCS-T) for unresectable HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer. METHODS: Patients received oral S-1 (40  mg/m(2)  b.i.d.) on days 1-14, intravenous cisplatin (60  mg/m(2)), docetaxel (50  mg/m(2)), and T-mab (8  mg/kg in the first cycle and 6  mg/kg in the second cycle and thereafter) on day 8 every 3  weeks. RESULTS: The study included 16 patients: median age, 60 (34-76) years; males/females, 11:5; intestinal-type/diffuse-type histology, 11:5; and HER2 3+/2+(FISH+), 13:3. The completion rate until the third cycle was 87.5  % (14/16) (95  %CI 71.3-103.7  %). Adverse events of grade 3/4 severity during the first 3 cycles were: leukopenia/neutropenia, 50.0:75.0  %; febrile neutropenia, 12.5  %; diarrhea, 12.5  %; and stomatitis, 12.5  %. All of these side effects were manageable and well controlled. There were no treatment-related deaths. The overall response rate was 93.8  % (15/16), and the response rate in patients with measurable lesions was 100  % (15/15). The median cycle to response was only 1 (1-3 cycles). Non-curative factors disappeared in 56.3  % (9/16) of patients, and conversion surgery (R0 resection) was performed in all these cases. Pathological response rates in primary and metastatic lesions were 88.9  % (8/9) and 100  % (9/9), respectively. The median PFS and OS were not reached during the median follow-up time of 18.3  months ranged from 11.0 to 34.3  months. CONCLUSIONS: DCS-T was feasible in patients with unresectable HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer. The observed response was very promising and warrants further investigation.

26093218|t|An overview of antifungal peptides derived from insect.
26093218|a|UNASSIGNED: Fungi are not classified as plants or animals. They resemble plants in many ways but do not produce chlorophyll or make their own food photosynthetically like plants. Fungi are useful for the production of beer, bread, medicine, etc. More complex than viruses or bacteria; fungi can be destructive human pathogens responsible for various diseases in humans. Most people have a strong natural immunity against fungal infection. However, fungi can cause diseases when this immunity breaks down. In the last few years, fungal infection has increased strikingly and has been accompanied by a rise in the number of deaths of cancer patients, transplant recipients, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients owing to fungal infections. The growth rate of fungi is very slow and quite difficult to identify. A series of molecules with antifungal activity against different strains of fungi have been found in insects, which can be of great importance to tackle human diseases. Insects secrete such compounds, which can be peptides, as a part of their immune defense reactions. Active antifungal peptides developed by insects to rapidly eliminate infectious pathogens are considered a component of the defense munitions. This review focuses on naturally occurring antifungal peptides from insects and their challenges to be used as armaments against human diseases.

26099447|t|Mid-luteal serum progesterone concentrations govern implantation rates for cryopreserved embryo transfers conducted under hormone replacement.
26099447|a|UNASSIGNED: This study explores the relevance of mid-luteal serum hormonal concentrations in cryopreserved embryo transfer cycles conducted under hormone replacement therapy (HRT) control and which involved single-embryo transfer (SET) of 529 vitrified blastocysts. Widely ranging mid-luteal oestradiol and progesterone concentrations ensued from the unique HRT regimen. Oestradiol had no influence on clinical pregnancy or live birth rates, but an optimal progesterone range between 70 and 99  nmol/l (P < 0.005) was identified in this study. Concentrations of progesterone below 50  nmol/l and above 99  nmol/l were associated with decreased implantation rates. There was no clear interaction between oestradiol and progesterone concentrations but embryo quality grading did show a significant influence on outcomes (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002 for clinical pregnancy and live birth rates, respectively). Multiple comparison analysis showed that the progesterone effect was influential regardless of embryo grading, body mass index or the woman's age, either at vitrification or at cryopreserved embryo transfer. The results support the argument that careful monitoring of serum progesterone concentrations in HRT-cryopreserved embryo transfer is warranted and that further studies should explore pessary adjustments to optimize concentrations for individual women to enhance implantation rates.

26101571|t|Identification of Jumonji AT-Rich Interactive Domain 1A Inhibitors and Their Effect on Cancer Cells.
26101571|a|Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1A (JARID1A), one of the jumonji C domain-containing histone demethylase (JHDM) family members, plays key roles in cancer cell proliferation and development of drug tolerance. Therefore, selective JARID1A inhibitors are potential anticancer agents. In this study, we searched for cell-active JARID1A inhibitors by screening hydroxamate compounds in our in-house library and the structural optimization based on docking study of the hit-compound to a homology model of JARID1A. As a result, we identified compound 6j, which selectively inhibits JARID1A over three other JHDM family members. Compound 7j, a prodrug form of compound 6j, induced a selective increase in the level of trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4, a substrate of JARID1A. Furthermore, compound 7j synergistically enhanced A549 human lung cancer cell growth inhibition induced by vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. These findings support the idea that JARID1A inhibitors have potential as anticancer agents.

26100904|t|Solid-liquid critical behavior of water in nanopores.
26100904|a|UNASSIGNED: Nanoconfined liquid water can transform into low-dimensional ices whose crystalline structures are dissimilar to any bulk ices and whose melting point may significantly rise with reducing the pore size, as revealed by computer simulation and confirmed by experiment. One of the intriguing, and as yet unresolved, questions concerns the observation that the liquid water may transform into a low-dimensional ice either via a first-order phase change or without any discontinuity in thermodynamic and dynamic properties, which suggests the existence of solid-liquid critical points in this class of nanoconfined systems. Here we explore the phase behavior of a model of water in carbon nanotubes in the temperature-pressure-diameter space by molecular dynamics simulation and provide unambiguous evidence to support solid-liquid critical phenomena of nanoconfined water. Solid-liquid first-order phase boundaries are determined by tracing spontaneous phase separation at various temperatures. All of the boundaries eventually cease to exist at the critical points and there appear loci of response function maxima, or the Widom lines, extending to the supercritical region. The finite-size scaling analysis of the density distribution supports the presence of both first-order and continuous phase changes between solid and liquid. At around the Widom line, there are microscopic domains of two phases, and continuous solid-liquid phase changes occur in such a way that the domains of one phase grow and those of the other evanesce as the thermodynamic state departs from the Widom line.

26077995|t|The role of open and laparoscopic stone surgery in the modern era of endourology.
26077995|a|UNASSIGNED: Treatment options for kidney stones and ureteral stones have evolved considerably over the past several decades, to the point where almost any stone can now be considered for treatment with a noninvasive or a minimally invasive approach including shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy. The safety and morbidity associated with these techniques are favourable relative to traditional open surgical approaches to stone removal. However, they also require unique skillsets, access to instrumentation and relatively high maintenance costs, potentially limiting their use on a global scale. Coincident with the emergence of endourology have been considerable improvements in laparoscopic surgical techniques to the point that nearly any open surgery can be performed in a minimally invasive laparoscopic fashion. Such approaches, including those with robotic assistance, have potential application for the treatment of upper urinary tract stones, particularly in complex senarios as well as in areas where access to endourological instruments might be limited.

26100003|t|Assessing the biochemical changes of tendons of rats in an experimental model of tenotomy under therapeutic ultrasound and LEDs (625 and 945  nm) by near-infrared Raman spectroscopy.
26100003|a|UNASSIGNED: Given the complexity of the tendon repair process, where the neoformed scar tissue tends to prevent or hamper the tendon from performing its normal functions, ultrasound (US) and light-emitting diode (LED) devices have been applied to modulate the tendon repair process. This study aimed to compare the anti-inflammatory and healing effects of therapeutic US and LED in an experimental model of tenotomy using histomorphometry and Raman spectroscopy. Forty Wistar rats (235        8.3  g) were separated into four groups: tenotomy (TC; control), tenotomy associated with ultrasound (US; 1  MHz, 0.5  W/cm(2)), tenotomy associated with LED at 625  nm (LR; 4  J/cm(2)), and tenotomy associated with LED at 945  nm (LIR; 4  J/cm(2)), in two experimental periods of 7 and 14  days. Histomorphometry showed a decrease of inflammatory cells (macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes) for the group treated with US compared to the TC group (ANOVA, p   <   0.0001) and the LIR group compared to the TC group (p   <   0.05) at the seventh day, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect. In relation to the LR and TC groups, there was no significant difference. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the LR group presented an increased synthesis of collagen I compared to the other treatments and the TC groups on the 14th day (p   <   0.01). US therapy showed an adjuvant effect with anti-inflammatory action, and the LED therapy at 625  nm showed an increase in collagen synthesis, contributing to the process of tendon healing.

26104315|t|Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for doxorubicin cardiomyopathy: hopes and fears.
26104315|a|Chemotherapy has made an essential contribution to cancer treatment in recent decades despite its adverse effects. As cancer survivors have increased, concern about ex-patient lifespan has become more important too. Doxorubicin is an effective anti-neoplastic drug that produces a cardiotoxic effect. Cancer survivors who received doxorubicin became more vulnerable to cardiac disease than the normal population did. Many efforts have been made to prevent cardiac toxicity in patients with cancer. However, current therapies cannot guarantee permanent cardiac protection. One of their main limitations is that they do not promote myocardium regeneration. In this review, we summarize and discuss the promising use of mesenchymal stem cells for cardio-protection or cardio-regeneration therapies and consider their regenerative potential without leaving aside their controversial effects on tumor progression.

26107253|t|Differential Survival for Men and Women with HIV/AIDS-Related Neurologic Diagnoses.
26107253|a|OBJECTIVES: Neurologic complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) frequently lead to disability or death in affected patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether survival patterns differ between men and women with HIV/AIDS-related neurologic disease (neuro-AIDS). METHODS: Retrospective cohort data from a statewide surveillance database for HIV/AIDS were used to characterize survival following an HIV/AIDS-related neurologic diagnosis for men and women with one or more of the following conditions: cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, primary central nervous system lymphoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and HIV-associated dementia. A second, non-independent cohort was formed using university-based cases to confirm and extend the findings from the statewide data. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the survival experiences for men and women in the cohorts. Cox regression was employed to characterize survival while controlling for potential confounders in the study population. RESULTS: Women (n=27) had significantly poorer outcomes than men (n=198) in the statewide cohort (adjusted hazard ratio=2.31, 95% CI: 1.22 to 4.35), and a similar, non-significant trend was observed among university-based cases (n=17 women, 154 men). Secondary analyses suggested that this difference persisted over the course of the AIDS epidemic and was not attributable to differential antiretroviral therapy responses among men and women. CONCLUSIONS: The survival disadvantage of women compared to men should be confirmed and the mechanisms underlying this disparity elucidated. If this relationship is confirmed, targeted clinical and public health efforts might be directed towards screening, treatment, and support for women affected by neuro-AIDS.

26116514|t|HIV-1 gp120 influences the expression of microRNAs in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells via STAT3 activation.
26116514|a|BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRs) are an abundant class of small non-coding RNAs (~22  nt) that reprogram gene expression by targeting mRNA degradation and translational disruption. An emerging concept implicates miR coupling with transcription factors in myeloid cell development and function, thus contributing to host defense and inflammation. The important role that these molecules play in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 is only now emerging. RESULTS: We provide evidence that exposure of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) to recombinant HIV-1 R5 gp120, but not to CCR5 natural ligand CCL4, influences the expression of a panel of miRs (i.e., miR-21, miR-155 and miR-181b) regulated by STAT3 and potentially targeting genes belonging to the STAT3 signaling pathway. The blockage of gp120-induced STAT3 activation impairs gp120 capacity to modulate the expression level of above mentioned miRs. Predictive analysis of miR putative targets emphasizes that these miRs share common target genes. Furthermore, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis outline that these genes mainly belong to biological processes related to regulation of transcription, in a complex network of interactions involving pathways relevant to HIV-DC interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results point to gp120-triggered modulation of miR expression via STAT3 activation as a novel molecular mechanism exploited by HIV-1 to affect DC biology and thus modulate the immune response through complex regulatory loops involving, at the same time, miRs and transcription factors.

The enzyme is associated with several diseases and is thought to play a role in the anti-parasite responses of the innate immune system. HCHT occurs in two isoforms, one 50 kDa (HCHT50) and one 39 kDa variant (HCHT39). Common for both isoforms is a catalytic domain with the (b/a)8 TIM barrel fold. HCHT50 has an additional linker-region, followed by a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) classified as CBM family 14 in the CAZy database. To gain further insight into enzyme functionality and especially the effect of the CBM, we expressed both isoforms and compared their catalytic properties on chitin and high molecular weight chitosans. HCHT50 degrades chitin faster than HCHT39 and much more efficiently. Interestingly, both HCHT50 and HCHT39 show biphasic kinetics on chitosan degradation where HCHT50 is faster initially and HCHT39 is faster in the second phase. Moreover, HCHT50 produces distinctly different oligomer distributions than HCHT39. This is likely due to increased transglycosylation activity for HCHT50 due the CBM extending the positive subsites binding surface and therefore promoting transglycosylation. Finally, studies with both chitin and chitosan showed that both isoforms have a similarly low degree of processivity. Combining functional and structural features of the two isoforms, it seems that HCHT combines features of exo-processive and endo-nonprocessive chitinases with the somewhat unusual CBM14 to reach a high degree of efficiency, in line with its alleged physiological task of being a "complete" chitinolytic machinery by itself.

26117072|t|Does Extended-Release Liposomal Bupivacaine Better Control Pain Than Bupivacaine After TKA? A Prospective, Randomized Clinical Trial.
26117072|a|UNASSIGNED: Liposomal bupivacaine periarticular injection (PAI) offers sustained bupivacaine release after TKA, but few prospective independent studies exist. In this prospective, blinded study, liposomal bupivacaine was randomized against bupivacaine and incorporated into a comprehensive multimodal pain management protocol. 111 primary TKAs were randomized to receive PAI: 58 patients received 266mg (20cc) liposomal bupivacaine mixed with 75mg (30cc) 0.25% bupivacaine, and 53 patients received 150mg (60cc) 0.25% bupivacaine. Visual analog pain scores and narcotic use were determined. No pain score differences occurred between study and control patients: Day 1: 4.5/4.6 (P=0.73); Day 2: 4.4/4.8 (P=0.27); or Day 3: 3.5/3.7 (P=0.58). Narcotic use was similar during hospitalization, 51.8/54.2 (P=0.34). The study medication costs  285, and the control medication costs  2.80. This finding does not justify the routine use of liposomal bupivacaine.

26117120|a|UNASSIGNED: The effect of centrifugal forces is analyzed in a pattern-forming reaction-diffusion system. Numerical simulations conducted on the appropriate extension of the Oregonator model for the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction show a great variety of dynamical behaviors in such a system. In general, the system exhibits an anisotropy that results in new types of patterns or in a global displacement of the previous one. We consider the effect of both constant and periodically modulated centrifugal forces on the different types of patterns that the system may exhibit. A detailed analysis of the patterns and behaviors observed for the different parameter values considered is presented here.

26117620|t|Are Statins out in the COLD? The STATCOPE Trial.
26117620|a|UNASSIGNED: A cardiologist and respirologist examined the recent, neutral Prospective Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Simvastatin in the Prevention of COPD Exacerbations (STATCOPE) for issues of relevance to cardiovascular risk reduction with statin medications. Although the potential benefit of the pleiotropic effects of statins on this inflammatory disease was not borne out, the effect over the longer term on total respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain unexplored. This study was unique as the only statin trial to date to use a national guideline (Adult Treatment Panel III) to exclude patients from the trial if at sufficient cardiovascular risk to warrant statin therapy. Furthermore, observed fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events were shown to provide some evidence to suggest that statins might reduce cardiovascular events despite the low risk category and the relatively low levels of cholesterol. The magnitude of this beneficial trend paralleled the magnitude of lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol achieved in the active statin arm. Finally, the authors questioned whether the current standard of care adequately includes adherence to any national lipid guideline or adequate attention to the cardiovascular comorbidity of these patients. In conclusion, knowledge translation of the STATCOPE trial should at a minimum encourage assessment of cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, implementation of proven cardiovascular risk reduction therapies based on national guidelines, including statins, and plans to undertake a trial adequate in size and duration to address cardiovascular event reduction in patients not already eligible for evidence-based risk-reducing therapies.

26115620|t|Biomechanical assessment in models of glaucomatous optic neuropathy.
26115620|a|UNASSIGNED: The biomechanical environment within the eye is of interest in both the regulation of intraocular pressure and the loss of retinal ganglion cell axons in glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Unfortunately, this environment is complex and difficult to determine. Here we provide a brief introduction to basic concepts of mechanics (stress, strain, constitutive relationships) as applied to the eye, and then describe a variety of experimental and computational approaches used to study ocular biomechanics. These include finite element modeling, direct experimental measurements of tissue displacements using optical and other techniques, direct experimental measurement of tissue microstructure, and combinations thereof. Thanks to notable technical and conceptual advances in all of these areas, we are slowly gaining a better understanding of how tissue biomechanical properties in both the anterior and posterior segments may influence the development of, and risk for, glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Although many challenging research questions remain unanswered, the potential of this body of work is exciting; projects underway include the coupling of clinical imaging with biomechanical modeling to create new diagnostic tools, development of IOP control strategies based on improved understanding the mechanobiology of the outflow tract, and attempts to develop novel biomechanically-based therapeutic strategies for preservation of vision in glaucoma.

26115714|t|[Contribution of synaptic release mechanisms to the building of sensory maps].
26115714|a|Numerous neurotransmitters have been implicated in neurodevelopmental processes. In addition, developing neurons show an abundance of vesicles in the growth cones, and express proteins of the SNARE complex early on. This has led to propose a role for vesicular fusion machinery in axonal growth and synapse formation. However, as the molecular machinery of vesicular fusion started to unveil, and knockouts for the major proteins of this complex were generated, it came as a surprise that none of these proteins was essential for the construction of brain architecture, although they were crucial for vital functions of the organism, leading to early mortality of exocytosis mutants. Because of this early death, conditional ablation of these genes in well-defined neuronal populations was necessary to study their role at later stages of neural circuit development, when activity-dependent mechanisms are best defined. Early studies showed that mutants of Munc18-1, a gene essential for both constitutive and calcium triggered release, were required for target dependent cell survival but not for axon growth or early refinement of topographic targeting, at least in the retinotectal system. Conditional knockout of the Rim1 and Rim2 genes allowed to interrogate more specifically the role of calcium-triggered release. Rims (rab interacting molecules) play a key role in the assembly of calcium channels and their coupling to the SNARE complex alters calcium-triggered release with little effect on constitutive release. When Rim1/Rim2 genes were ablated in the thalamus, layer IV neurons failed to organize into barrel structures, and to form the characteristic asymmetric distribution of their dendrites. More surprisingly, thalamocortical axons still organized in precise topographic maps and formed well differentiated synapses despite considerable reduction of calcium-induced synaptic release. However, this reduction in release probability altered axon targeting in the visual system where axons from both eyes compete for the same target. Thus, genetic tools targeting the exocytosis machinery are allowing to dissect more precisely the contribution of synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms to activity-dependent circuit wiring.

26116716|t|Insect gut symbiont's susceptibility to host antimicrobial peptides caused by alteration of bacterial cell envelope.
26116716|a|UNASSIGNED: The molecular characterization of symbionts is pivotal for understanding the cross-talk between symbionts and hosts. In addition to valuable knowledge obtained from symbiont genomic studies, the biochemical characterization of symbionts is important to fully understand symbiotic interactions. The bean bug (Riptortus pedestris) has been recognized as a useful experimental insect gut symbiosis model system due to its cultivable Burkholderia symbionts. This system is greatly advantageous because it allows for acquisition of a large quantity of homogeneous symbionts from the host midgut. Using these na  ve gut symbionts, it was possible to directly compare in vivo symbiotic cells with in vitro cultured cells using biochemical approaches. With the goal of understanding molecular changes that occur in Burkholderia cells as they adapt to the Riptortus gut environment, we first elucidated that symbiotic Burkholderia cells are highly susceptible to purified Riptortus antimicrobial peptides. In search of the mechanisms of the increased immunosusceptibility of symbionts, we found striking differences in the cell envelope structures between cultured and symbiotic Burkholderia cells. The bacterial lipopolysaccharide O-antigen was absent from symbiotic cells examined by gel electrophoretic and mass spectrometric analyses, and their membranes were more sensitive to the detergent lysis. These changes in the cell envelope were responsible for the increased susceptibility of the Burkholderia symbionts to host innate immunity. Our results suggest that the symbiotic interactions between the Riptortus host and Burkholderia gut symbionts induce bacterial cell envelope changes to achieve successful gut symbiosis.

26037632|t|Dietary nitrate modulates cerebral blood flow parameters and cognitive performance in humans: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover investigation.
26037632|a|UNASSIGNED: Nitrate derived from vegetables is consumed as part of a normal diet and is reduced endogenously via nitrite to nitric oxide. It has been shown to improve endothelial function, reduce blood pressure and the oxygen cost of sub-maximal exercise, and increase regional perfusion in the brain. The current study assessed the effects of dietary nitrate on cognitive performance and prefrontal cortex cerebral blood-flow (CBF) parameters in healthy adults. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups study, 40 healthy adults received either placebo or 450ml beetroot juice (~5.5mmol nitrate). Following a 90minute drink/absorption period, participants performed a selection of cognitive tasks that activate the frontal cortex for 54min. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to monitor CBF and hemodynamics, as indexed by concentration changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated-haemoglobin, in the frontal cortex throughout. The bioconversion of nitrate to nitrite was confirmed in plasma by ozone-based chemi-luminescence. Dietary nitrate modulated the hemodynamic response to task performance, with an initial increase in CBF at the start of the task period, followed by consistent reductions during the least demanding of the three tasks utilised. Cognitive performance was improved on the serial 3s subtraction task. These results show that single doses of dietary nitrate can modulate the CBF response to task performance and potentially improve cognitive performance, and suggest one possible mechanism by which vegetable consumption may have beneficial effects on brain function.

We focus on 1) the distribution of the trabeculae in two types of beetles with a six-fold difference in density, the structure of the trabeculae and a proposed 3D model with an integrated trabeculae-honeycomb structure; 2) finite element analyses and experimental results showing that the average anti-peeling strength in the presence of trabeculae can be as much as approximately three-fold greater than that in the absence of trabeculae; 3) the strengthening mechanisms of these structures and describe an optimized double thin-walled biomimetic structure that possesses excellent absorption and buffering properties; 4) the development of technologies to produce fully integrated honeycomb plates with short fibers as a reinforced composite material and the verification that these plates are strong and lightweight and exhibit good integrity. Finally, we note the shortcomings in China in this field of research and propose possible future research directions in the field of biomimetic functional materials.

26117740|t|Electrochemical detection of hydrogen peroxide on platinum-containing tetrahedral amorphous carbon sensors and evaluation of their biofouling properties.
26117740|a|UNASSIGNED: Hydrogen peroxide is the product of various enzymatic reactions, and is thus typically utilized as the analyte in biosensors. However, its detection with conventional materials, such as noble metals or glassy carbon, is often hindered by slow kinetics and biofouling of the electrode. In this study electrochemical properties and suitability to peroxide detection as well as ability to resist biofouling of Pt-doped ta-C samples were evaluated. Pure ta-C and pure Pt were used as references. According to the results presented here it is proposed that combining ta-C with Pt results in good electrocatalytic activity towards H2O2 oxidation with better tolerance towards aqueous environment mimicking physiological conditions compared to pure Pt. In biofouling experiments, however, both the hybrid material and Pt were almost completely blocked after immersion in protein-containing solutions and did not produce any peaks for ferrocenemethanol oxidation or reduction. On the contrary, it was still possible to obtain clear peaks for H2O2 oxidation with them after similar treatment. Moreover, quartz crystal microbalance experiment showed less protein adsorption on the hybrid sample compared to Pt which is also supported by the electrochemical biofouling experiments for H2O2 detection.

26121676|t|Accuracy of Detecting Residual Disease After Cross Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Cancer (preSANO Trial): Rationale and Protocol.
26121676|a|BACKGROUND: Results from the recent CROSS trial showed that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) significantly increased survival as compared to surgery alone in patients with potentially curable esophageal cancer. Furthermore, in the nCRT arm 49% of patients with a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 23% of patients with an adenocarcinoma (AC) had a pathologically complete response in the resection specimen. These results provide a rationale to reconsider and study the timing and necessity of esophagectomy in (all) patients after application of the CROSS regimen. OBJECTIVE: We propose a "surgery as needed" approach after completion of nCRT. In this approach, patients will undergo active surveillance after completion of nCRT. Surgical resection would be offered only to those patients in whom residual disease or a locoregional recurrence is highly suspected or proven. However, before a surgery as needed approach in oesophageal cancer patients (SANO) can be tested in a randomized controlled trial, we aim to determine the accuracy of detecting the presence or absence of residual disease after nCRT (preSANO trial). METHODS: This study is set up as a prospective, single arm, multicenter, diagnostic trial. Operable patients with potentially curable SCC or AC of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction will be included. Approximately 4-6 weeks after completion of nCRT all included patients will undergo a first clinical response evaluation (CRE-I) including endoscopy with (random) conventional mucosal biopsies of the primary tumor site and of any other suspected lesions in the esophagus and radial endo-ultrasonography (EUS) for measurement of tumor thickness and area. Patients in whom no locoregional or disseminated disease can be proven by cytohistology will be offered a postponed surgical resection 6-8 weeks after CRE-I (ie, approximately 12-14 weeks after completion of nCRT). In the week preceding the postponed surgical resection, a second clinical response evaluation (CRE-II) will be planned that will include a whole body PET-CT, followed again by endoscopy with (random) conventional mucosal biopsies of the primary tumor site and any other suspected lesions in the esophagus, radial EUS for measurement of tumor thickness and area, and linear EUS plus fine needle aspiration of PET-positive lesions and/or suspected lymph nodes. The main study parameter is the correlation between the clinical response assessment during CRE-I and CRE-II and the final pathological response in the resection specimen. RESULTS: The first patient was enrolled on July 23, 2013, and results are expected in January 2016. CONCLUSIONS: If this preSANO trial shows that the presence or absence of residual tumor can be predicted reliably 6 or 12 weeks after completion of nCRT, a randomized trial comparing nCRT plus standard surgery versus chemoradiotherapy plus "surgery as needed" will be conducted (SANO trial).

26121552|t|Electronic Doping and Redox-Potential Tuning in Colloidal Semiconductor Nanocrystals.
26121552|a|UNASSIGNED: Electronic doping is one of the most important experimental capabilities in all of semiconductor research and technology. Through electronic doping, insulating materials can be made conductive, opening doors to the formation of p-n junctions and other workhorses of modern semiconductor electronics. Recent interest in exploiting the unique physical and photophysical properties of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals for revolutionary new device technologies has stimulated efforts to prepare electronically doped colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals with the same control as available in the corresponding bulk materials. Despite the impact that success in this endeavor would have, the development of general and reliable methods for electronic doping of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals remains a long-standing challenge. In this Account, we review recent progress in the development and characterization of electronically doped colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals. Several successful methods for introducing excess band-like charge carriers are illustrated and discussed, including photodoping, outer-sphere electron transfer, defect doping, and electrochemical oxidation or reduction. A distinction is made between methods that yield excess band-like carriers at thermal equilibrium and those that inject excess charge carriers under thermal nonequilibrium conditions (steady state). Spectroscopic signatures of such excess carriers, accessible by both equilibrium and nonequilibrium methods, are reviewed and illustrated. A distinction is also proposed between the phenomena of electronic doping and redox-potential shifting. Electronically doped semiconductor nanocrystals possess excess band-like charge carriers at thermal equilibrium, whereas redox-potential shifting affects the potentials at which charge carriers are injected under nonequilibrium conditions, without necessarily introducing band-like charge carriers at equilibrium. Detection of the key spectroscopic signatures of band-like carriers allows distinction between these two regimes. Both electronic doping and redox-potential shifting can be powerful tools for tuning the performance of nanocrystals in electronic devices. Finally, key chemical challenges associated with nanocrystal electronic doping are briefly discussed. These challenges are centered largely on the availability of charge-carrier reservoirs with suitable redox potentials and on the relatively poor control over nanocrystal surface traps. In most cases, the Fermi levels of colloidal nanocrystals are defined by the redox properties of their surface traps. Control over nanocrystal surface chemistries is therefore essential to the development of general and reliable strategies for electronically doping colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals. Overall, recent progress in this area portends exciting future advances in controlling nanocrystal compositions, surface chemistries, redox potentials, and charge states to yield new classes of electronic nanomaterials with attractive physical properties and the potential to stimulate unprecedented new semiconductor technologies.

26120584|t|The Dual Role of Nrf2 in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Regulation of Antioxidant Defenses and Hepatic Lipid Metabolism.
26120584|a|Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a progressive liver disease with ever-growing incidence in the industrialized world. It starts with the simple accumulation of lipids in the hepatocyte and can progress to the more severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is associated with inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. There is increasing awareness that reactive oxygen species and electrophiles are implicated in the pathogenesis of NASH. Transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a positive regulator of the expression of a battery of genes involved in the protection against oxidative/electrophilic stress. In rodents, Nrf2 is also known to participate in hepatic fatty acid metabolism, as a negative regulator of genes that promote hepatosteatosis. We review relevant evidence in the literature that these two mechanisms may contribute to the protective role of Nrf2 in the development of hepatic steatosis and in the progression to steatohepatitis, particularly in young animals. We propose that age may be a key to explain contradictory findings in the literature. In summary, Nrf2 mediates the crosstalk between lipid metabolism and antioxidant defense mechanisms in experimental models of NAFLD, and the nutritional or pharmacological induction of Nrf2 represents a promising potential new strategy for its prevention and treatment.

26120746|t|Recognizing encephalopathy and delirium in the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation setting.
26120746|a|OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the prevalence, underlying mechanisms, and challenges of treating encephalopathy and delirium in the postsurgical and medically compromised cardiopulmonary patient receiving services on an acute inpatient rehabilitation unit. Additionally, pertinent information is provided on conducting an evaluation to assess for neurocognitive sequelae of the above-mentioned conditions to help achieve better treatment outcomes. METHOD: Review of the medical and neuropsychology literature is provided along with 2 case reports to illustrate evaluation of a persisting toxic-metabolic encephalopathy and a resolving delirium and the treatment team's effectiveness in producing a more optimal treatment outcome. The unique role of the rehabilitation psychologist, special treatment considerations, and the importance of integrated follow-up neurorehabilitation services for the cardiopulmonary patient and caregivers also are emphasized. RESULTS: Encephalopathy and delirium are 2 related, but somewhat different, conditions that can emerge postoperatively, any time during acute care hospitalization, and often enough, during impatient or subacute-care rehabilitation. Their association with long-term harm and poor outcome warrant early identification and immediate medical intervention. IMPLICATIONS: Encephalopathy and delirium can significantly affect rehabilitation outcomes and, as such, rehabilitation psychologists are encouraged to systematically screen for the presence of delirium and encephalopathy in the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation setting so to enhance treatment efficacy and quality of life in affected individuals.

26120856|t|[Intestinal Parasitism in Terena Indigenous People of the Province of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil].
26120856|a|UNASSIGNED: Objective Considering that intestinal protozoans and helminths infect more than half of the world population, with high prevalence in the poorest regions, the objective of this study was to conduct parasitological research among indigenous Terena people established in the state of MatoGrosso do Sul. An inquiry was performed to find the incidence of parasitism in these communities. Methodology 134 aliquots of feces from individuals of the indigenous community were examined. Samples were conserved in Merthiolate-iodine-formol solution (MIF). The laboratory exams were carried out using the techniques of Hoffman, Pons and Janer; Willis and Kinyoun. Results We identified infections of nematode helminths of the species Ascarislumbricoides, Ancylostomidae, Enterobiusvermicularis, Strongyloidesstercoralis, and Trichuristrichiura; and cestodes of the species Hymenolepis nana and Taenia spp. Also found were the protozoan species: Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia lamblia, Endolimax nana, Entamoeba coli, and Entamoebahistolytica. 23.1 % of the samples studied were negative. Of the 76.9 % of samples with parasites, there were non-statistically significant differences in parasitism between men and women examined between 1 and 33 years-of-age. There were also no significant differences between monospecific parasitism and with concurrent species. In terms of parasitic diversity, seven species of nematode and cestodeshelminths were found along with five species of Archamoebae protozoa: flagellates and enterozoans. Conclusions These results were the basis for orientation and appropriate drug intervention and reveal the need for the implementation governmental, social and educational measures to improve the living conditions of that community.

26119174|t|Analytical and clinical performance of Abbott RealTime MTB, an assay for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in pulmonary specimens.
26119174|a|UNASSIGNED: Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-based assays provide fast and sensitive results compared to conventional TB tests. The performance of the new Abbott Molecular MTB assay for the qualitative detection of MTB complex using the automated m2000    system or manual sample preparation is summarized in this paper. The assay detects eight MTB complex subspecies. The observed limit of detection (LOD) when used to test an MTB H37Rv panel was 2.45 colony forming units (cfu)/mL, while the claimed assay LOD with this MTB strain is 17  cfu/mL. No cross reactivity, or carryover were observed in the study. The clinical sensitivity of the assay was 93% overall; 99% in smear positive, culture positive specimens, and 81% in smear negative, culture positive samples. The clinical specificity was 97%. The inhibition rate in the study was 0.34%. The data suggest that Abbott RealTime MTB is a reliable, robust and sensitive assay for the molecular detection of MTB.

26049036|t|Opponent backgrounds reduce discrimination sensitivity to competing motions: Effects of different vertical motions on horizontal motion perception.
26049036|a|UNASSIGNED: We examined the relationship between two distinct motion phenomena. First, locally balanced stimuli in which opposing motion signals are presented spatially near one another fail to cause a robust firing pattern in brain area MT. The brain's response to this motion is effectively suppressed, a phenomenon known as opponency. Second, past research has found that discrimination sensitivity to a target motion is negatively affected by a superimposed irrelevant motion signal - a process we call "perceptual suppression." In the current study, we examined how opponency affects the strength of perceptual suppression. We found unexpected results: a target motion embedded within an opponent background was harder to discriminate than a target motion embedded within a non-opponent background. We argue that this pattern of results runs contrary to the clear prediction stemming from the current understanding of the role of opponency in motion processing and tentatively offer an explanation based on recent MT physiology.

26056740|t|Life cycle and vectorial competence of Triatoma williami (Galv  o, Souza e Lima, 1965) under the influence of different blood meal sources.
26056740|a|UNASSIGNED: Triatoma williami is naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi, the ethiological agent of Chagas disease, the most significant cause of morbidity and mortality in South and Central America.The possibility of domiciliation of T. williami increases the risk of human T. cruzi vetorial transmission. Despite this, there is a lack of data demonstrating the bionomic aspects, the vectorial competence or the natural ecotope and the wild hosts of T. williami. This study describes for the first time the life cycle of T. williami under the influence of two blood meal sources and also evaluates the vectorial potential of the species. The development of two groups of hundred triatomines was followed over the nymphal stages and adulthood. Each group was exposed to a sole blood meal source, mammalian or bird. The average egg-to-adult development time in both groups was similar, except by shorter stages of N3 and N4 in triatomines fed on mammals. The group fed on birds needed more blood feedings to suffer the ecdysis and had higher cumulative mortality in the nymphal stages. Although the observed delay at defecation of adults after feeding, our results suggest that T. williami in the third and fifth nymphal stages may be good vectors.

26057113|t|A novel approach to identify time-frequency oscillatory features in electrocortical signals.
26057113|a|BACKGROUND: Sensory, motor, and cognitive events could not only evoke phase-locked event-related potentials in ongoing electrocortical signals, but also induce non-phase-locked changes of oscillatory activities. These oscillatory activities, whose functional significances differ greatly according to their temporal, spectral, and spatial characteristics, are commonly detected when single-trial signals are transformed into time-frequency distributions (TFDs). Parameters characterizing oscillatory activities are normally measured from multi-channel TFDs within a time-frequency region-of-interest (TF-ROI), pre-defined using a hypothesis-driven or data-driven approach. However, both approaches could ignore the possibility that the pre-defined TF-ROI contains several spatially/functionally distinct oscillatory activities. NEW METHOD: We proposed a novel approach based on topographic segmentation analysis to optimally and automatically identify detailed time-frequency features. This approach, which could effectively exploit the spatial information of oscillatory activities, has been validated in both simulation and real electrocortical studies. RESULTS: Simulation study showed that the proposed approach could successfully identify noise-contaminated time-frequency features if their signal-to-noise ratio was relatively high. Real electrocortical study demonstrated that several time-frequency features with distinct scalp distributions and evident neurophysiological functions were identified when the same analysis was applied on stimulus-elicited TFDs. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed approach could provide an optimal identification of detailed time-frequency features by making use of their distinct spatial distributions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrated the validity and usefulness of the presented approach in isolating detailed time-frequency features, thus having wide applications in cognitive neuroscience to provide a precise assessment of the functional significance of oscillatory activities.

26118514|t|Sirsasana (headstand) technique alters head/neck loading: Considerations for safety.
26118514|a|BACKGROUND: This study examined the weight-bearing responsibility of the head and neck at moments of peak force during three headstand techniques. METHODS: Three matched groups of 15 each (18-60 years old) were formed based upon lower limb entry/exit technique: symmetrical extended, symmetrical flexed, and asymmetrical flexed. All 45 practitioners performed 3 headstands. Kinematics and kinetics were analyzed to locate peak forces acting on the head, loading rate, center of pressure (COP) and cervical alignment. FINDINGS: During entry, symmetrical extended leg position trended towards the lowest loads as compared to asymmetrical or symmetrical flexed legs (Cohen's d  =  0.53 and 0.39 respectively). Also, symmetrical extended condition produced slower loading rates and more neutral cervical conditions during loading. INTERPRETATION: Subjects loaded the head with maximums of 40-48% of total body weight. The data support the conclusion that entering the posture with straight legs together may reduce the load and the rate of change of that load.

26120591|t|Abnormal hippocampal-thalamic white matter tract development and positive symptom course in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis.
26120591|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Abnormal development of the hippocampus has been reported in adolescents at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis and thalamic abnormalities have been found. However, the white matter connections between the hippocampus and the thalamus have not been studied. The connections between these regions are of key importance to our understanding of the pathophysiology of psychosis. METHODS: Twenty-six UHR and 21 healthy age-matched controls were tested at a baseline assessment and 12 months later. Symptoms were assessed at both the time points and all the participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging scans. We used tractography to trace the white matter connections in each individual between the thalamus and hippocampus and then extracted fractional anisotropy (FA) to assess white matter structural integrity. RESULTS: There was a significant group by time interaction indicating that FA decreased in UHR, and increased in controls over 12 months. Across both groups, baseline FA of the thalamic-hippocampal tract was predictive of positive symptoms at 12-month follow-up. Critically, this pattern remained significant in UHR individual group alone. At baseline, those with higher FA, indicative of abnormal white matter development, show higher positive symptoms 1 year later. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we provide evidence to indicate that there are differences in white matter development in hippocampal-thalamic connections, both of which are important nodes in networks associated with schizophrenia. Furthermore, abnormal developmental patterns in UHR individuals are associated with positive symptom course.

26118210|t|[INDUCED HYPOTHERMIA AFTER CARDIAC ARREST].
26118210|a|INTRODUCTION: Sudden cardiac death in adults remains a challenge in cardiovascular medicine. Cardiac arrest often drives neurological damage resulting from cerebral hypoxia, causing a series of cellulose tissue alterations that lead to brain injury. Therapeutic hypothermia decreases oxygen demand acting as protection to the brain. OBJECTIVES: To describe the casuistry of hypothermia after retourn of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at Bellvitge University Hospital (BUH) from 2009 to 2012. Develop a tracking sheet of the induced hypothermia process. Reflect professional experience of induced hypothermia after cardiac arrest through a case. METHODOLOGY: Retrospective descriptive study of the 54 cases, 45 men and 9 women, aged between ages 57 (15 to 80) years old treated with hypothermia after ROSC at BUH. Analysis of sociodemographic variables, specific variables and description of the inclusion criteria for hypothermia. Design of nursing record to express standardized care to undertake during the HI and its pilot trial. Monitoring a 60 years old patient who suffers cardiopulmonary arrest and is subjected to hypothermia. RESULTS: Leading cause of cardiopulmonary arrest is acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (63%). Most representative initial rhythm is pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (PVT/VF) (68.5%). There is longer survival in patients whose CPR is less than 30 minutes. The.target temperature of the patients was 33   C for 24 hours, except for 5 patients who were stopped because of hemodynamic instability. At discharge, 54% were exitus, 4% had severe encephalopathy, 11% mild encephalopathy and 31% without neurological sequel. The applicability of the nursing record that was created for the HI process was checked, which allowed a fast overview of the procedure. It describes the clinical status of the case on admission, during the HI, at 48 hours, at discharge from the coronary care unit (CCU) and at discharge. DISCUSSION: The data collected between 2009 and 2012 of patients with cardiopulmonary arrest candidates to hypothermia showed a favorable neurological recovery within the surviving patients. Additionally, patients with cardiopulmonary arrest not prolonged have a better prognosis agreeing with ROSC previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: Hypothermia is a viable therapy for patients who have undergone cardiopulmonary arrest. It is important to make a specific assessment of each case as well as agree the track record of care applied to these patients to subsequently allow their assessment.

26119816|t|The Human Phenotype Ontology: Semantic Unification of Common and Rare Disease.
26119816|a|UNASSIGNED: The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is widely used in the rare disease community for differential diagnostics, phenotype-driven analysis of next-generation sequence-variation data, and translational research, but a comparable resource has not been available for common disease. Here, we have developed a concept-recognition procedure that analyzes the frequencies of HPO disease annotations as identified in over five million PubMed abstracts by employing an iterative procedure to optimize precision and recall of the identified terms. We derived disease models for 3,145 common human diseases comprising a total of 132,006 HPO annotations. The HPO now comprises over 250,000 phenotypic annotations for over 10,000 rare and common diseases and can be used for examining the phenotypic overlap among common diseases that share risk alleles, as well as between Mendelian diseases and common diseases linked by genomic location. The annotations, as well as the HPO itself, are freely available.

26120075|t|Pharmacodynamics and tolerability of repository corticotropin injection in healthy human subjects: A comparison with intravenous methylprednisolone.
26120075|a|UNASSIGNED: Repository corticotropin injection (porcine adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] analog) and intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) are used to treat inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) exacerbations and rheumatoid arthritis. This multiple-dose, randomized, crossover, open-label study evaluated and compared pharmacodynamic outcomes in subjects who received ACTH analog (80   U subcutaneously) or IVMP (1   g) daily for five days. Specific outcome measures included IVMP and cortisol concentrations, total cortisol-equivalent exposure, immune cell population changes, and tolerability. IVMP and ACTH analog increased granulocyte numbers and decreased lymphocyte counts; effects on both were significantly less pronounced with ACTH analog. Based on total cortisol-equivalent exposure (assuming linearity), administration of 80   U of ACTH analog equates to 30   mg IVMP. Because IVMP doses significantly higher than 30   mg are usually required to treat MS exacerbations, the lower cortisol-equivalent exposure of 80   U ACTH analog supports the hypothesis that efficacy of ACTH analog results from both steroid-dependent and -independent properties. Adverse events were mild in severity; subject incidence for adverse-event reporting was similar following both regimens. The clinical relevance of these findings in autoimmune disease populations is unknown and requires further evaluation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

26002420|t|Identification of peculiar and common effects of histone modifications on transcription.
26002420|a|UNASSIGNED: Histone modifications (HMs) play an important role in controlling eukaryotic gene expression and next generation sequencing (NGS) has greatly advanced the research on this topic with generating many high-resolution maps for HMs. Here, we use these maps to analyze the relationship between HMs and transcription. By incorporating various segments of genes into analysis without restricting the scope only in the promoter region, we have collected more comprehensive data and captured some details of this process. A position effect of gene regions has been revealed and it can even inverse the property of some HMs from activating to repressing genes such as the cases of H3K4me3, H3K36me3 and H3K14ac. Especially H3K36me3, its dual character on gene transcription makes it able to serve as a criterion to distinguish high and low expressed genes. We also study the general property of different HMs based on the comprehensive data. Using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), we have extracted 4 latent structures underlying the HMs, which are able to represent their activating and repressing effects concisely. These 4 factors have fine properties in the aspects of distinguishing high and low expressed genes, predicting transcription level and identifying genes with unique attributes such as stable RNA generating genes found to have a close relationship with lifespan of organisms here. In summary, while the position effect associated HM peculiarities demonstrate some details of the complex HM regulation network divergently, the common factors catch the nature of the network convergently. This deepens our understanding on the HM-transcription relationship.

26101141|t|Ambulatory and diary methods can facilitate the measurement of patient-reported outcomes.
26101141|a|PURPOSE: Ambulatory and diary methods of self-reported symptoms and well-being have received increasing interest in recent years. These methods are a valuable addition to traditional strategies for the assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in that they capture patients' recent symptom experiences repeatedly in their natural environments. In this article, we review ways that incorporating diary methods into PRO measurement can facilitate research on quality of life. METHODS: Several diary methods are currently available, and they include "real-time" (Ecological Momentary Assessment) and "near-real-time" (end-of-day assessments, Day Reconstruction Method) formats. We identify the key benefits of these methods for PRO research. RESULTS: (1) In validity testing, diary assessments can serve as a standard for evaluating the ecological validity and for identifying recall biases of PRO instruments with longer-term recall formats. (2) In research and clinical settings, diaries have the ability to closely capture variations and dynamic changes in quality of life that are difficult or not possible to obtain from traditional PRO assessments. (3) In test construction, repeated diary assessments can expand understanding of the measurement characteristics (e.g., reliability, dimensionality) of PROs in that parameters for differences between people can be compared with those for variation within people. CONCLUSIONS: Diary assessment strategies can enrich the repertoire of PRO assessment tools and enhance the measurement of patients' quality of life.

26065625|t|Cytotoxicity of the association of pesticides Roundup Transorb   and Furadan 350 SC   on the zebrafish cell line, ZF-L.
26065625|a|UNASSIGNED: The present study aimed to ascertain the cytotoxicity of pesticides commonly used in rice cultivation, through in vitro assays employing the ZF-L cell line. The in vitro analyses investigated three cellular targets (cell membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity and lysosomal stability) in cells exposed to concentrations of Roundup Transorb   (67.7 gL(-1), 135.4 gL(-1) and 270.8 gL(-1)), Furadan 350 SC   (0.1 gL(-1), 0.05 gL(-1) and 0.02 gL(-1)). We also tested these products in combination. We analyzed the defensive capacity of the cells by measuring the activity of xenobiotic extruder proteins, as well as the expression of these same proteins. Cytotoxic effects of both pesticides were observed individually, as well as with the mixture of both products; including an inhibitory effect on the activity of xenobiotic extrusion. When exposed to the insecticide Furadan, and also the mixture of Furadan and Roundup, there was an increase in the expression of P glycoproteins (P-gps). There was also a negative correlation with cytotoxicity, mainly exhibited by mitochondrial activity and lysosomal integrity, but also with respect to the activity of P-gps. We observed that concentrations below those allowed by law were toxic regarding all parameters tested in this study, with the exception of mitochondrial function. Taken together, our results suggest that toxicity may be due to the surfactants present in the commercial formulations.

26003667|t|High-fat diet-induced deregulation of hippocampal insulin signaling and mitochondrial homeostasis deficiences contribute to Alzheimer disease pathology in rodents.
26003667|a|UNASSIGNED: Global obesity is a pandemic status, estimated to affect over 2 billion people, that has resulted in an enormous strain on healthcare systems worldwide. The situation is compounded by the fact that apart from the direct costs associated with overweight pathology, obesity presents itself with a number of comorbidities, including an increased risk for the development of neurodegenerative disorders. Alzheimer disease (AD), the main cause of senile dementia, is no exception. Spectacular failure of the pharmaceutical industry to come up with effective AD treatment strategies is forcing the broader scientific community to rethink the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to cognitive decline. To this end, the emphasis is once again placed on the experimental animal models of the disease. In the current study, we have focused on the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) on hippocampal-dependent memory in C57/Bl6 Wild-type (WT) and APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice, a well-established mouse model of familial AD. Our results indicate that the continuous HFD administration starting at the time of weaning is sufficient to produce b-amyloid-independent, hippocampal-dependent memory deficits measured by a 2-object novel-object recognition test (NOR) in mice as early as 6months of age. Furthermore, the resulting metabolic syndrome appears to have direct effects on brain insulin regulation and mitochondrial function. We have observed pathological changes related to both the proximal and distal insulin signaling pathway in the brains of HFD-fed WT and APP/PS1 mice. These changes are accompanied by a significantly reduced OXPHOS metabolism, suggesting that mitochondria play an important role in hippocampus-dependent memory formation and retention in both the HFD-treated and AD-like rodents at a relatively young age.

26118392|t|Treatment of severe non-infectious uveitis in high-risk conditions (Part 2): systemic infections; management and safety issues.
26118392|a|INTRODUCTION: Management of patients with severe immune-mediated uveitis requires the use of immunosuppressive (IS) drugs in selected cases. This may be particularly challenging in certain patients with associated conditions, which may increase the risk of side effects or modify guidelines for the use of such drugs. Chronic viral and mycobacterial infections in the setting of non-infectious uveitis create a number of diagnostic but also therapeutic dilemmas to clinicians because they can be exacerbated by IS therapies with detrimental effects. Areas covered: In this review, we will focus on very specific chronic infections that can be affected by IS therapies: human immunodeficiency virus infection, chronic hepatitis virus infection and tuberculosis. The main aim of this review is to provide an updated and comprehensive practical guide for practitioners regarding the therapeutic decision-making and management of patients with non-infectious uveitis affected by the aforementioned infectious conditions. Expert opinion: Clinicians should be aware of the risk of viral and mycobacterial reactivation of an underlying infection during IS therapy. However, most of these conditions do not represent an absolute contraindication if one were able to apply an appropriate prior screening and close monitoring of such therapy.

26115764|t|Tamoxifen induces a pluripotency signature in breast cancer cells and human tumors.
26115764|a|UNASSIGNED: Tamoxifen is the treatment of choice in estrogen receptor alpha breast cancer patients that are eligible for adjuvant endocrine therapy. However,    50% of ERa-positive tumors exhibit intrinsic or rapidly acquire resistance to endocrine treatment. Unfortunately, prediction of de novo resistance to endocrine therapy and/or assessment of relapse likelihood remain difficult. While several mechanisms regulating the acquisition and the maintenance of endocrine resistance have been reported, there are several aspects of this phenomenon that need to be further elucidated. Altered metabolic fate of tamoxifen within patients and emergence of tamoxifen-resistant clones, driven by evolution of the disease phenotype during treatment, appear as the most compelling hypotheses so far. In addition, tamoxifen was reported to induce pluripotency in breast cancer cell lines, in  vitro. In this context, we have performed a whole transcriptome analysis of an ERa-positive (T47D) and a triple-negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231), exposed to tamoxifen for a short time frame (hours), in order to identify how early pluripotency-related effects of tamoxifen may occur. Our ultimate goal was to identify whether the transcriptional actions of tamoxifen related to induction of pluripotency are mediated through specific ER-dependent or independent mechanisms. We report that even as early as 3 hours after the exposure of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen, a subset of ERa-dependent genes associated with developmental processes and pluripotency are induced and this is accompanied by specific phenotypic changes (expression of pluripotency-related proteins). Furthermore we report an association between the increased expression of pluripotency-related genes in ERa-positive breast cancer tissues samples and disease relapse after tamoxifen therapy. Finally we describe that in a small group of ERa-positive breast cancer patients, with disease relapse after surgery and tamoxifen treatment, ALDH1A1 (a marker of pluripotency in epithelial cancers which is absent in normal breast tissue) is increased in relapsing tumors, with a concurrent modification of its intra-cellular localization. Our data could be of value in the discrimination of patients susceptible to develop tamoxifen resistance and in the selection of optimized patient-tailored therapies.

26116057|t|Collagen and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 in the ewe cervix during the estrous cycle.
26116057|a|UNASSIGNED: The cervical collagen remodeling during the estrous cycle of the ewe was examined. The collagen concentration determined by a hydroxyproline assay and the area occupied by collagen fibers (%C), determined by van Gieson staining, were assessed in the cranial and caudal cervix of Corriedale ewes on Days 1 (n  =  6), 6 (n  =  5), or 13 (n  =  6) after estrous detection (defined as Day 0). In addition, the gelatinase activity by in situ and SDS-PAGE gelatin zymographies and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9, respectively) expression by immunohistochemistry were determined. The collagen concentration and %C were lowest on Day 1 of the estrous cycle (P  <  0.04), when MMP-2 activity was highest (P  <  0.006) and the ratio of activated to latent MMP-2 trend to be highest (P  =  0.0819). The MMP-2 activity was detected in 73% of the homogenized cervical samples, and its expression was mainly detected in active fibroblasts. By contrast, the MMP-9 activity was detected in 9% of the samples, and its scarce expression was associated with plasmocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression was maximal on Day 1 in the cranial cervix and on Day 13 in the caudal cervix and was lower in the cranial than in the caudal cervix (P  <  0.0001). This time-dependent increase in MMP-2 expression that differed between the cranial and caudal cervix may reflect their different physiological roles. The decrease in the collagen content and increase in fibroblast MMP-2 activity in sheep cervix on Day 1 of the estrous cycle suggests that cervical dilation at estrus is due to the occurrence of collagen fiber degradation modulated by changes in periovulatory hormone levels.

26034930|t|Oral health-related quality of life of implant-supported overdentures versus conventional complete prostheses: Retrospective study of a cohort of edentulous patients.
26034930|a|BACKGROUND: This work aims to confirm if implant-supported overdentures are a good treatment option for edentulous patients and offer an improvement in quality of life compared with traditional complete prostheses (dentures). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective clinical descriptive study included three evaluation groups: validation group (n=57); control group of patients with complete removeable prostheses (n=56); study group of patients with implant-supported overdentures retained with the Locator   system (n=80). The study also validated the Oral Health Impact Profile-20 questionnaire. Individual protocols were created that included socio-demographic data, the Oral Health Impact Profile-20 (OHIP-20) questionnaire and Oral Satisfaction Scale (OSS). Descriptive and bivariate statistical analysis was carried out applying     , Pearson, Kruskal-Wallis, and Student t tests, transferring data into SPSS-Windows   software from a Microsoft   Excel spreadsheet. RESULTS: The OHIP-20 proved to be a valid instrument and provided reliable assessment of health-related quality of life among both the Spanish general population and edentulous patients. The control and study groups proved comparable, showing socio-demographic homogeneity. For patients with overdentures retained by means of the Locator   system, these restorations had significantly lower impact on quality of life (19 vs 33), both generally and for each individual questionnaire item, and much higher satisfaction with the state of their oral cavities (8.3 vs 5.3) than patients wearing dentures; both sets of data showed a direct linear relationship, so that as the level of impact on quality of life increased, perceived oral satisfaction worsened. CONCLUSIONS: Patients rehabilitated with implant supported overdentures retained by the Locator   system, presented significantly lower levels of impact on their quality of life and significantly higher oral satisfaction than patients with conventional complete prostheses.

26114951|t|Real-time distortion correction of spiral and echo planar images using the gradient system impulse response function.
26114951|a|PURPOSE: MRI-guided interventions demand high frame rate imaging, making fast imaging techniques such as spiral imaging and echo planar imaging (EPI) appealing. In this study, we implemented a real-time distortion correction framework to enable the use of these fast acquisitions for interventional MRI. METHODS: Distortions caused by gradient waveform inaccuracies were corrected using the gradient impulse response function (GIRF), which was measured by standard equipment and saved as a calibration file on the host computer. This file was used at runtime to calculate the predicted k-space trajectories for image reconstruction. Additionally, the off-resonance reconstruction frequency was modified in real time to interactively deblur spiral images. RESULTS: Real-time distortion correction for arbitrary image orientations was achieved in phantoms and healthy human volunteers. The GIRF-predicted k-space trajectories matched measured k-space trajectories closely for spiral imaging. Spiral and EPI image distortion was visibly improved using the GIRF-predicted trajectories. The GIRF calibration file showed no systematic drift in 4 months and was demonstrated to correct distortions after 30 min of continuous scanning despite gradient heating. Interactive off-resonance reconstruction was used to sharpen anatomical boundaries during continuous imaging. CONCLUSIONS: This real-time distortion correction framework will enable the use of these high frame rate imaging methods for MRI-guided interventions.

26112066|t|Age Differences in the Association Between Body Mass Index Class and Annualized Medicare Expenditures.
26112066|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to assess the relationship between body mass index (BMI) class and Medicare claims among young-old (65-69), old (70-74), and old-old (75+) adults over a 10-year period. METHOD: We assessed costs by BMI class and age group among 9,300 respondents to the 1998 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) with linked 1998-2008 Medicare claims data. BMI was classified as normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), mild obesity (30-34.9), or severe obesity (35 or above). RESULTS: Annualized total Medicare claims adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, education, and smoking history were 109% greater for severely obese young-old adults in comparison with normal weight young-old adults (US 9,751 vs. US 4,663). Total annualized claim differences between the normal weight and severely obese in the old and old-old groups were not statistically significant. DISCUSSION: Excess Medicare expenditures related to obesity may be concentrated among severely obese young-old adults. Preventing severe obesity among middle and older aged adults may have large cost implications for society.

26114514|t|A Three-Dimensional Statistical Average Skull: Application of Biometric Morphing in Generating Missing Anatomy.
26114514|a|PURPOSE: The utilization of three-dimensional modeling technology in craniomaxillofacial surgery has grown exponentially during the last decade. Future development, however, is hindered by the lack of a normative three-dimensional anatomic dataset and a statistical mean three-dimensional virtual model. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a protocol to generate a statistical three-dimensional virtual model based on a normative dataset of adult skulls. METHOD: Two hundred adult skull CT images were reviewed. The average three-dimensional skull was computed by processing each CT image in the series using thin-plate spline geometric morphometric protocol. Our statistical average three-dimensional skull was validated by reconstructing patient-specific topography in cranial defects. The experiment was repeated 4 times. In each case, computer-generated cranioplasties were compared directly to the original intact skull. The errors describing the difference between the prediction and the original were calculated. RESULTS: A normative database of 33 adult human skulls was collected. Using 21 anthropometric landmark points, a protocol for three-dimensional skull landmarking and data reduction was developed and a statistical average three-dimensional skull was generated. Our results show the root mean square error (RMSE) for restoration of a known defect using the native best match skull, our statistical average skull, and worst match skull was 0.58, 0.74, and 4.4mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to statistically average craniofacial surface topography will be a valuable instrument for deriving missing anatomy in complex craniofacial defects and deficiencies as well as in evaluating morphologic results of surgery.

26047723|t|Repeated forced swim stress prior to complete Freund's adjuvant injection enhances mechanical hyperalgesia and attenuates the expression of pCREB and   FosB and the acetylation of histone H3 in the insular cortex of rat.
26047723|a|UNASSIGNED: Exposure to stressors causes substantial effects on the perception and response to pain. In several animal models, chronic stress produces hyperalgesia. The insular (IC) and anterior cingulate cortices (ACC) are the regions exhibiting most reliable pain-related activity. And the IC and ACC play an important role in pain modulation via descending pain modulatory system. In the present study we examined the expression of phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) and   FosB and the acetylation of histone H3 in the IC and ACC after forced swim stress (FS) and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection to clarify changes in the cerebral cortices that affect the activity of the descending pain modulatory system in rats with stress-induced hyperalgesia. CFA injection into the hindpaw or FS (day 1, 10min; days 2-3, 20min) induced a significant increase in the expression of pCREB and   FosB and the acetylation of histone H3 in the IC. Quantitative image analysis showed that the numbers of   FosB-immunoreactivity (IR) cells in the bilateral anterior and posterior IC (AIC and PIC) were significantly higher in the CFA group (AIC R, 548.0  98.6; AIC L, 433.5  89.4; PIC R, 546.1  72.8; PIC L, 415.5  53.5) than those in the naive group (AIC R, 86.6  14.8; AIC L, 85.5  24.7; PIC R, 124.5  29.9; PIC L, 107.0  19.8, p<0.01). However the FS prior to the CFA injection enhanced the mechanical hyperalgesia and attenuated the expression of pCREB and   FosB and the acetylation of histone H3 in the IC. There was no significant difference in the numbers of   FosB-IR cells in the bilateral PIC between the FS+CFA and naive groups. These findings suggest neuroplasticity in the IC after the FS, which may be involved in the enhancement of CFA-induced mechanical hyperalgesia through dysfunction of the descending pain modulatory system.

26113087|t|Activation-induced cytidine deaminase contributes to pancreatic tumorigenesis by inducing tumor-related gene mutations.
26113087|a|UNASSIGNED: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) develops via an accumulation of various gene mutations. The mechanism underlying the mutations in PDA development, however, is not fully understood. Recent insight into the close association between the mutation pattern of various cancers and specific mutagens led us to investigate the possible involvement of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a DNA editing enzyme, in pancreatic tumorigenesis. Our immunohistochemistry findings revealed AID protein expression in human acinar ductal metaplasia (ADM), pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), and PDA. Both the amount and intensity of the AID protein expression increased with the progression from precancerous to cancerous lesions in human PDA tissues. To further assess the significance of ectopic epithelial AID expression in pancreatic tumorigenesis, we analyzed the phenotype of AID transgenic (AID Tg) mice. Consistent with our hypothesis that AID is involved in the mechanism of the mutations underlying pancreatic tumorigenesis, we found precancerous lesions developing in the pancreas of AID Tg mice. Using deep sequencing, we also detected Kras and c-Myc mutations in our analysis of the whole pancreas of AID Tg mice. In addition, Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of Kras, c-Myc and Smad4 mutations with the typical mutational footprint of AID in precancerous lesions in AID Tg mice separated by laser capture microdissection. Taken together, our findings suggest that AID contributes to the development of pancreatic precancerous lesions by inducing tumor-related gene mutations. Our new mouse model without intentional manipulation of specific tumor-related genes provides a powerful system for analyzing the mutations involved in PDA.

26050287|t|Surgical pain management at the Medical School of Salerno (11th-13th centuries).
26050287|a|Before the advent of general anesthesia, only poorly effective remedies were known to relieve pain. Although classical medical authorities describe a number of elaborate surgical techniques, no references about some forms of anesthesia are reported. Only the authors of pharmaceutical or botanical texts mention the use of substances, especially mandrake, to induce sleep in the patient. The first and most detailed evidences of general anesthesia described in medical texts of the western world can be found at the Medical School of Salerno. However, the use of substances aimed to relieve pain or to induce sleep during surgery is mentioned only by the authors of pharmaceutical or botanical texts and not by surgeons. Furthermore, the efficacy of these preparations to produce a profound and lasting sleep is doubtful. The general impression is that surgeons knew how to relieve pain, but considered it a necessary appendix of surgery and therefore an incisive effort to eliminate it was not pursued.

26071489|t|ANNALS EXPRESS: Pneumatic tube transport of blood stained cerebrospinal fluid specimens has no clinically significant effect on rates of haemolysis compared to manual transport.
26071489|a|BACKGROUND: Pneumatic tube transport of pathology specimens from the emergency department to the laboratory for analysis is a widely used practice. When compared to manual specimen transport, it results in savings in both time and labour. Sampling of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) still forms part of the workup of patients with suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage. There are claims in the literature that transport of CSF samples by pneumatic tube results in excess haemolysis which interferes with CSF analysis for the presence of bilirubin. The aim of our study was to ascertain whether pneumatic tube transport of blood stained CSF to the laboratory, results in clinically significantly higher levels of haemolysis compared with manual transport of the same specimens. METHODS: Stored CSF was spiked with varying amounts of red blood cells creating 72 specimens of varying red cell concentration. Half of these specimens were transported to the laboratory manually whilst the other half were sent by pneumatic tube transport. The rates of haemolysis were compared between the pneumatic tube and manual transport samples. RESULTS: There was no clinically significant difference in the rates of haemolysis between the samples transported to the laboratory by pneumatic tube compared with those moved manually. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumatic tube transport of CSF to the laboratory is not associated with clinically significantly higher rates of haemolysis when compared to manual transport.

Therefore, we investigated the dosimetry of [(68)Ga]Ga-DO3A-VS-Cys(40)-Exendin-4 based on the biodistribution data in rats, pigs, non-human primates (NHP) and a human.Organ distribution of [(68)Ga]Ga-DO3A-VS-Cys(40)-Exendin-4 in rats (Male Lewis; n=12; 30, 60, and 80 min) was measured ex vivo. The dynamic uptake of [(68)Ga]Ga-DO3A-VS-Cys(40)-Exendin-4 in the abdomen was assessed by PET/CT scanning of pigs (male; n = 4, 0-60 min), NHP (Female; cynomolgus; n=3; 0-90 min), and human (female; n=1; 0-40, 100, 120 min).The organ distribution data in each species were extrapolated to those of a human, assuming similar distribution between the species. Residence times were assessed by trapezoidal approximation of the kinetic data. Organ doses (mGy/MBq) and the whole body effective dose (mSv/MBq), was extrapolated by using the OLINDA/EXM 1.1 software. The extrapolated human whole body effective dose was 0.017    0.004 (rats), 0.014    0.004 (pigs), 0.017    0.004 (NHP), and 0.016 (human) mSv/MBq. The absorbed dose to the kidneys was limiting:0.33    0.06 (rats), 0.28  0.05 (pigs), 0.65    0.11 (NHP), and 0.28 (human) mGy/MBq, which corresponded to the maximum yearly administered amounts of 455 (rat), 536 (pig), 231 (NHP), and 536 (human) MBq before reaching the yearly kidney limiting dose of 150 mGy. More than 200 MBq of [(68)Ga]Ga-DO3A-VS-Cys(40)-Exendin-4 can be administered yearly in a human, allowing for repeated (2-4 times) scanning. This potentially enables longitudinal clinical PET imaging studies of the GLP-1R in the pancreas, transplanted islets, or insulinoma.

26066427|t|Search for the Dark Photon and the Dark Higgs Boson at Belle.
26066427|a|The dark photon A^{'} and the dark Higgs boson h^{'} are hypothetical constituents featured in a number of recently proposed dark sector models. Assuming prompt decays of both dark particles, we search for their production in the so-called Higgstrahlung channel e^{+}e^{-} > A^{'}h^{'}, with h^{'} > A^{'}A^{'}. We investigate ten exclusive final states with A^{'} > e^{+}e^{-},  ^{+} ^{-}, or   ^{+}  ^{-} in the mass ranges 0.1      GeV/c^{2}   <m_{A^{'}}<3.5      GeV/c^{2} and 0.2      GeV/c^{2}   <m_{h^{'}}<10.5      GeV/c^{2}. We also investigate three inclusive final states 2(e^{+}e^{-})X, 2( ^{+} ^{-})X, and (e^{+}e^{-})( ^{+} ^{-})X, where X denotes a dark photon candidate detected via missing mass, in the mass ranges 1.1      GeV/c^{2}   <m_{A^{'}}<3.5      GeV/c^{2} and 2.2      GeV/c^{2}   <m_{h^{'}}<10.5      GeV/c^{2}. Using the entire 977      fb^{-1} data set collected by Belle, we observe no significant signal. We obtain individual and combined 90% credibility level upper limits on the branching fraction times the Born cross section, B*  _{Born}, on the Born cross section   _{Born}, and on the dark photon coupling to the dark Higgs boson times the kinetic mixing between the standard model photon and the dark photon, a_{D}*  ^{2}. These limits improve upon and cover wider mass ranges than previous experiments. The limits from the final states 3(  ^{+}  ^{-}) and 2(e^{+}e^{-})X are the first placed by any experiment. For a_{D} equal to 1/137, m_{h^{'}}<   8      GeV/c^{2}, and m_{A^{'}}<1      GeV/c^{2}, we exclude values of the mixing parameter    above    8*10^{-4}.

26062729|t|'Trust my doctor, trust my pancreas': trust as an emergent quality of social practice.
26062729|a|BACKGROUND: Growing attention is being paid to the importance of trust, and its corollaries such as mistrust and distrust, in health service and the central place they have in assessments of quality of care. Although initially focussing on doctor-patient relationships, more recent literature has broadened its remit to include trust held in more abstract entities, such as organisations and institutions. There has consequently been growing interest to develop rigorous and universal measures of trust. METHODS: Drawing on illustrative ethnographic material from observational research in a UK diabetes clinic, this paper supports an approach that foregrounds social practice and resists conceiving trust as solely a psychological state that can be divorced from its context. Beyond exploring the less-than-conscious nature of trust, the interpretations attend to the extent to which trust practices are distributed across a range of actors. RESULTS: Data from clinical encounters reveal the extent to which matters of trust can emerge from the relationships between people, and sometimes people and things, as a result of a wide range of pragmatic concerns, and hence can usefully be conceived of as an extended property of a situation rather than a person. Trust is rarely explicitly articulated, but remains a subtle feature of experience that is frequently ineffable. CONCLUSIONS: A practice approach highlights some of the problems with adopting a general psychological or intellectualist conception of trust. In particular, assuming it is a sufficiently stable internal state that can be stored or measured not only transforms a diffuse and often ephemeral quality into a durable thing, but ultimately presents it as a generic state that has meaning independent of the specific relationships and context that achieve it. Emphasising the context-specific nature of trust practices does not dismiss the potential of matters of trust, when they emerge, to be transposed to other contexts. But it does highlight how, on each occasion, trust as a relational quality is ways 'done' or 'achieved' anew.

26064358|t|Association of rs5368 and rs3917406 polymorphisms in E-selectin gene with premature coronary artery disease in Chinese Han population.
26064358|a|OBJECTIVES: Genetics polymorphism of the E-selectin affects the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). We aimed to investigate the association between the rs5368 and rs3917406 polymorphisms in E-selectin genes and premature CAD (PCAD) in Chinese Han population. METHODS: PCAD 628 patients and 732 controls were included in the study. E-selectin of rs5368 and rs3917406 polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The frequencies of T allele of the rs5368 and rs3917406 polymorphisms were 27.2% and 47.8%, respectively, in the PCAD group, and 30.5% and 42.8% in the control group. The frequency of the T allele of the rs3917406 polymorphism was significantly higher in the PCAD group than in the control group (x(2) = 6.857, P = 0.009). In contrast, no statistically significant difference was found between controls and patients in the frequency of T allele of the rs5368 polymorphism. The univariate analysis showed that the E-selectin rs3917406 polymorphisms was associated with the PCAD in additive model (OR = 1.226, 95% CI = 1.05-1.43, P = 0.010) and dominant model (OR = 1.406, 95% CI = 1.11-1.78, P = 0.005). After adjusting for potential confounding variables the rs3917406 polymorphisms was independently associated with PCAD in additive model (OR = 1.347, 95% CI = 1.12-1.62, P = 0.002) and dominant model (OR = 1.669, 95% CI = 1.26-2.21, P < 0.001). The E-selectin rs5368 polymorphisms were not associated with PCAD in univariate and multivariate analyses of three models. CONCLUSION: Among the Chinese Han population, the rs3917406 polymorphism of the E-selectin gene was associated with PCAD in univariate and multivariate analysis, however, no significant correlation between the E-selectin rs5368 polymorphism and PCAD.

26066741|t|Progression to Legal Blindness in Patients With Normal Tension Glaucoma: Hospital-Based Study.
26066741|a|PURPOSE: To determine the probability of an eye with normal tension glaucoma (NTG) progressing to legal blindness under standard ophthalmic care. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with NTG (n = 382) between 1985 and 2007 at Gifu University Hospital were followed for at least 5 years under standard ophthalmic care. The collected data included the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), and visual field status. Blindness was defined as a BCVA of <20/400 or a constriction of the central visual field to <10   according to the World Health Organization criteria. Kaplan-Meier life table analysis was used to estimate the probability of progressing to blindness in one or both eyes. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period after diagnosis was 13.3    5.4 years with a range of 5.0 to 29.1 years. At diagnosis, 18 patients (4.7%) had unilateral blindness due to glaucoma. At final examination, 34 patients had progressed to unilateral blindness and 5 to bilateral blindness. The Kaplan-Meier life table analysis estimate for unilateral blindness was 5.8    1.3% at 10 years and 9.9    1.9% at 20 years. Similarly, that for bilateral blindness was 0.3    0.3% at 10 years and 1.4    0.8% at 20 years. A Cox proportional hazard model analysis showed that a lower initial BCVA (P < 0.001), a worse initial AGIS (Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study) score (P = 0.002), and the frequency of changing glaucoma medications during the follow-up periods (P < 0.001) were significantly correlated with the development of blindness in at least one eye. CONCLUSIONS: The probability of blindness in eyes with NTG is much lower than previously reported in patients with high-tension glaucoma. Nevertheless, special care should be taken to follow NTG patients, and especially those with worse BCVA and more advanced visual field loss at diagnosis.

26081885|a|OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to determine the tick species infested to the cattle and small ruminants in K  tahya Province and their seasonal activity and prevalence. METHODS: Examination was performed in terms of infestation in 2402 farm animals and their shelters in 10 villages between October 2010 and October 2011. RESULTS: The infestation rate of animals was detected as 9.55%. A total of 657 adult ticks were collected. A total of 11 tick species consisting of Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes hexagonus, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus, Dermacentor marginatus, Hyalomma marginatum, Haemaphysalis parva, Haemaphysalis sulcata, Haemaphysalis punctata, Rhipicephalus bursa, Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Rhipicephalus turanicus were determined. Seasonal fluctuations of tick species were also determined. Ixodes ricinus and R. (Boophilus) annulatus species were encountered mostly during fall and winter months. Dermacentor marginatus was usually found in winter time. Hyalomma marginatum, was found between April and July. Haemaphysalis parva was found in October, November and March. Haemaphysalis sulcata was found in November and March. Haemaphysalis punctata was found only in March and November. Rhipicephalus species were generally found in late spring and summer. CONCLUSION: Finally, these results will be helpful for the determination of control methods of tick infestations and tick-borne diseases in the region.

26081935|t|Chronic Generalized Harassment During College: Influences on Alcohol and Drug Use.
26081935|a|UNASSIGNED: The experience of chronic generalized harassment from others can have a deleterious impact on individuals over time. Specifically, coping resources may be taxed, resulting in the use of avoidant coping strategies such as substance use. However, little is known about the experience of chronic generalized harassment (e.g., verbal hostility, manipulation by others, exclusion from important events) and its impact on substance use in collegiate populations. In the current study, we examined the latent growth of generalized harassment across the transition from high school to college, whether this growth was heterogeneous, and the relationships between latent generalized harassment classifications and substance use. Incoming freshmen students (N  =  2890; 58  % female; 53  % white) at eight colleges in Illinois completed a web survey at five points: fall 2011 (baseline), spring 2012 (T1), fall 2012 (T2), fall 2013 (T3) and fall 2014 (T4). Students were required to be at least 18  years old at baseline, and were compensated with online gift certificates. Two-part latent class growth analysis was implemented in order to examine heterogeneous growth over time. The results supported a two-class solution (infrequent and chronic classes) for generalized harassment. Growth in harassment was characterized by a decrease from baseline through college entry, with a recovery in rates by T3. Members of the chronically harassed class had greater mean generalized harassment over time, and were less likely to report zero instances of harassment experiences. As hypothesized, membership in the chronic class predicted future binge drinking, drinking to intoxication, problems due to alcohol use, and cigarette use, but not marijuana use. Future interventions should focus on providing college students with resources to help cope with distress stemming from persistent generalized harassment from peers, faculty, and other individuals in higher-education settings.

26083464|a|UNASSIGNED: Diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL)-a and -b are enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Selective and reversible inhibitors are required to study the function of DAGLs in neuronal cells in an acute and temporal fashion, but they are currently lacking. Here, we describe the identification of a highly selective DAGL inhibitor using structure-guided and a chemoproteomics strategy to characterize the selectivity of the inhibitor in complex proteomes. Key to the success of this approach is the use of comparative and competitive activity-based proteome profiling (ABPP), in which broad-spectrum and tailor-made activity-based probes are combined to report on the inhibition of a protein family in its native environment. Competitive ABPP with broad-spectrum fluorophosphonate-based probes and specific b-lactone-based probes led to the discovery of a-ketoheterocycle LEI105 as a potent, highly selective and reversible dual DAGL-a/DAGL-b inhibitor. LEI105 did not affect other enzymes involved in endocannabinoid metabolism including abhydrolase domain-containing protein 6, abhydrolase domain-containing protein 12, monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty acid amide hydrolase and did not display affinity for the cannabinoid CB1 receptor. Targeted lipidomics revealed that LEI105 concentration-dependently reduced 2-AG levels, but not anandamide levels, in Neuro2A cells. We show that cannabinoid CB1-receptor-mediated short-term synaptic plasticity in a mouse hippocampal slice model can be reduced by LEI105. Thus, we have developed a highly selective DAGL inhibitor and provide new pharmacological evidence to support the hypothesis that 'on demand biosynthesis' of 2-AG is responsible for retrograde signaling.

26076920|t|Prospective study of coffee consumption and all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular mortality in Swedish women.
26076920|a|UNASSIGNED: We investigated whether coffee consumption was associated with all-cause, cancer, or cardiovascular mortality in a prospective cohort of 49,259 Swedish women. Of the 1576 deaths that occurred in the cohort, 956 were due to cancer and 158 were due to cardiovascular disease. We used Cox proportional hazard models with adjustment for potential confounders to estimate multivariable relative risks (RR) and 95  % confidence intervals (CI). Compared to a coffee consumption of 0-1 cups/day, the RR for all cause-mortality was 0.81 (95  % CI 0.69-0.94) for 2-5 cups/day and 0.88 (95  % CI 0.74-1.05) for >5 cups/day. Coffee consumption was not associated with cancer mortality or cardiovascular mortality when analyzed in the entire cohort. However, in supplementary analyses of women over 50  years of age, the RR for all cause-mortality was 0.74 (95  % CI 0.62-0.89) for 2-5 cups/day and 0.86 (95  % CI 0.70-1.06) for >5  cups/day when compared to 0-1  cups/day. In this same subgroup, the RRs for cancer mortality were 1.06 (95  % CI 0.81-1.38) for 2-5 cups/day and 1.40 (95  % CI 1.05-1.89) for >5  cups/day when compared to 0-1  cups/day. No associations between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality, cancer mortality, or cardiovascular mortality were observed among women below 50  years of age. In conclusion, higher coffee consumption was associated with lower all-cause mortality when compared to a consumption of 0-1  cups/day. Furthermore, coffee may have differential effects on mortality before and after 50  years of age.

26085798|a|Leptodiranycthemera Werner, 1901, was described from a specimen collected in Ecuador. No information on the holotype was published after its description. In the most recent review of Leptodeira, Leptodiranycthemera was considered to be a synonym of Leptodeiraannulataannulata, although the author emphasized that the holotype was lost and did not include the pholidotic data from the original description in his account of Leptodeiraannulataannulata. Since this review, a number of authors have accepted this synonymy. Recently, analyzing specimens of Leptodeira in the Museum f  r Naturkunde, Berlin, Germany, we discovered the holotype of Leptodiranycthemera. This holotype is re-described here, and its correct identity is determined. Based on the analysis of meristic characters and the color of the holotype, we recognize Leptodiranycthemera as a junior synonym of Oxyrhopuspetolarius.

26087257|t|Protozoan Parasite Growth Inhibitors Discovered by Cross-Screening Yield Potent Scaffolds for Lead Discovery.
26087257|a|UNASSIGNED: Tropical protozoal infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality world-wide; four, in particular (human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), Chagas disease, cutaneous leishmaniasis, and malaria) have an estimated combined burden of over 87 million disability-adjusted life-years. New drugs are needed for each of these diseases. Building on the previous identification of NEU-617 (1) as a potent and non-toxic inhibitor of proliferation for the HAT pathogen (Trypanosoma brucei), we have now tested this class of analogs against other protozoal species: T. cruzi (Chagas disease), Leishmania major (cutaneous leishmaniasis), and Plasmodium falciparum (malaria). Based on hits identified in this screening campaign, we describe the preparation of several replacements for the quinazoline scaffold and report these inhibitors' biological activities against these parasites. In doing this, we have identified several potent proliferation inhibitors for each pathogen, such as for T. cruzi (4-((3-chloro-4-((3-fluorobenzyl)oxy)phenyl)amino)-6-(4-((4-methyl-1,4-diazepan-1-yl)sulfonyl)phenyl)quinoline-3-carbonitrile, NEU-924, 83), and L. major and P. falciparum (N-(3-chloro-4-((3-fluorobenzyl)oxy)phenyl)-7-(4-((4-methyl-1,4-diazepan-1-yl)sulfonyl)phenyl)cinnolin-4-amine, NEU-1017, 68).

26085437|t|Autoregulation monitoring and outcome prediction in neurocritical care patients: Does one index fit all?
26085437|a|UNASSIGNED: Indexes PRx and Mx have been formerly introduced to assess cerebral autoregulation and have been shown to be associated with 3-month clinical outcome. In a mixed cohort of neurocritical care patients, we retrospectively investigated the impact of selected clinical characteristics on this association. Forty-one patients (18-77  years) with severe traumatic (TBI, N  =  20) and non-traumatic (N  =  21) brain injuries were studied. Cerebral blood flow velocity, arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure were repeatedly recorded during 1-h periods. Calculated PRx and Mx were correlated with 3-month clinical outcome score of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) in different subgroups with specific clinical characteristics. Both PRx and Mx correlated significantly with outcome (PRx: r  =  0.38, p  <  0.05; AUC  =  0.64, n.s./Mx: r  =  0.48, p  <  0.005; AUC  =  0.80, p  <  0.005) in the overall group, and in patients with hemicraniectomy (N  =  17; PRx: r  =  0.73, p  <  0.001; AUC  =  0.89, p  <  0.01/Mx: r  =  0.69, p  <  0.005; AUC  =  0.87, p  <  0.05). Mx, not PRx, correlated significantly with mRS in patients with heart failure (N  =  17; r  =  0.69, p  <  0.005; AUC  =  0.92, p  <  0.005), and in non-traumatic patients (r  =  0.49, p  <  0.05; AUC  =  0.79, p  <  0.05). PRx, not Mx, correlated significantly with mRS in TBI patients (r  =  0.63, p  <  0.01; AUC  =  0.89, p  <  0.01). Both indexes did not correlate with mRS in diabetes patients (N  =  15), PRx failed in hypocapnic patients (N  =  26). Both PRx and Mx were significantly associated with 3-month clinical outcome, even in patients with hemicraniectomy. PRx was more appropriate for TBI patients, while Mx was better suited for non-traumatic patients and patients with heart failure. Prognostic values of indexes were affected by diabetes (both Mx and PRx) and hypocapnia (PRx only).

26085841|t|Application of next-generation sequencing for 24-chromosome aneuploidy screening of human preimplantation embryos.
26085841|a|BACKGROUND: Aneuploidy is a leading cause of repeat implantation failure and recurrent miscarriages. Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) enables the assessment of the numeral and structural chromosomal errors of embryos before transfer in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has been demonstrated to be an accurate PGS method and in present thought to be the gold standard, but new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), continue to emerge. Validation of the new comprehensive NGS-based 24-chromosome aneuploidy screening technology is still needed to determine the preclinical accuracy before it might be considered as an alternative method for human PGS. RESULTS: In the present study, 43 human trophectoderm (TE) biopsy samples and 5 cytogenetically characterized cell lines (Coriell Cell Repositories) were tested. The same whole genome amplified product of each sample was blindly assessed with Veriseq NGS and Agilent aCGH to identify the aneuploidy status. The result showed that the NGS identified all abnormalities identified in aCGH including the numeral chromosomal abnormalities (again or loss) in the embryo samples and the structural (partial deletion and duplication) in the Coriell cell lines. Both technologies can identify a segmental imbalance as small as 1.8  Mb in size. Among the 41 TE samples with abnormal karyotypes in this study, eight (19.5  %) samples presented as multiple chromosome abnormalities. The abnormalities occurred to almost all chromosomes, except chromosome 6, 7, 17 and Y chromosome. CONCLUSIONS: Given its reliability and high level of consistency with an established aCGH methodology, NGS has demonstrated a robust high-throughput methodology ready for extensive clinical application in reproductive medicine, with potential advantages of reduced costs and enhanced precision. Then, a randomized controlled clinical trial confirming its clinical effectiveness is advisable to obtain a larger sequencing dataset and more evidence for the extensive use of NGS-based PGS.

26087253|t|Effect of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease on Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Could Be Dependent on Age.
26087253|a|UNASSIGNED: There is a gap between the association of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and renal function in an apparently healthy population. This study aims to assess whether NAFLD is associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels and to understand early changes of eGFR in NAFLD. A cross-sectional study was performed among apparently healthy persons who underwent general health screening including laboratory assessments and hepatic ultrasonography from January 2013 to December 2013 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, College of Medicine, China. This study included 1,193 subjects with a mean age of 48 years. Prevalence of NAFLD was 31.3%. Mean eGFR was significantly lower in NAFLD than in controls (107    19 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs. 113    23 mL/min/1.73 m2, P<0.001). Correlation analysis between eGFR and NAFLD related risk factors revealed an inverse correlation between eGFR levels and some NAFLD risk factors (all P<0.01). All subjects were classified into five phases according to age. Average eGFR levels of NAFLD were lower than controls in three phases for subjects with  <= 50 years of age (all P<0.05), while there were no significant differences on average eGFR levels between NAFLD and controls in two phases for subjects with >50 years of age (Both P>0.05). The eGFR level is significantly associated with NAFLD and its risk factors in an apparently healthy population. Effects of NAFLD on eGFR could be dependent on age.

26078556|t|Exclusive enteral nutrition in children with Crohn's disease.
26078556|a|Exclusive enteral nutrition involves the use of a complete liquid diet, with the exclusion of normal dietary components for a defined period of time, as a therapeutic measure to induce remission in active Crohn's disease (CD). This very efficacious approach leads to high rates of remission, especially in children and adolescents newly diagnosed with CD. This intervention also results in mucosal healing, nutritional improvements and enhanced bone health. Whilst several recent studies have provided further elaboration of the roles of exclusive enteral nutrition in the management of CD, other reports have provided new understanding of the mechanisms by which this intervention acts.

26091625|t|Integrated miRNA and mRNA expression profiling of tension force-induced bone formation in periodontal ligament cells.
26091625|a|UNASSIGNED: Tension force-induced bone formation is a complex biological process altered by various factors, for example miRNAs and gene regulatory network. However, we know little about critical gene regulators and their functional consequences on this complex process. The aim of this study was to determine the integrated relation between microRNA and mRNA expression in tension force-induced bone formation in periodontal ligament cells by a system biological approach. We identified 818 mRNAs and 32 miRNAs differentially expressed between cyclic tension force-stimulated human periodontal ligament cells and control cells by microarrays. By using miRNA/mRNA network analysis, protein-protein interactions network analysis, and hub analysis, we found that miR-195-5p, miR-424-5p, miR-1297, miR-3607-5p, miR-145-5p, miR-4328, and miR-224-5p were core microRNAs of tension force-induced bone formation. WDR33, HSPH1, ERBB3, RIF1, IKBKB, CREB1, FGF2, and PAG1 were identified as hubs of the PPI network, suggesting the biological significance in this process. The miRNA expression was further examined in human PDLC and animal samples by using quantitative real-time PCR. Thus, we proposed a model of tension force-induced bone formation which is co-regulated through integration of the miRNA and mRNA. This study illustrated the benefits of system biological approaches in the analysis of tension force-induced bone formation as a complex biological process. We used public information and our experimental data to do comprehensive analysis and revealed the coordination transcriptional control of miRNAs of tension force-induced bone formation.

26075057|t|Monitoring cow comfort and rumen health indices in a cubicle-housed herd with an automatic milking system: a repeated measures approach.
26075057|a|BACKGROUND: Cow rumination and lying behaviour are potentially useful and interrelated indicators of cow health and welfare but there is conflicting evidence about how reliable these measures are. The objective of this study was to quantify the variation of indices of cow comfort and rumen health in a herd with an automatic milking system for which husbandry was relatively constant, in order to propose an alternative approach to optimising the use of these indices when continuous monitoring is not available. During a period of 28  days, standing index, cud chewing index and rumination index were observed. RESULTS: The daily mean standing index ranged between 9.0 and 18.0 per cent, cud chewing index between 43.5 and 74.0 per cent, and rumination index between 49.0 and 81.0 per cent. The point of lowest variation in the indices was determined as that with the lowest coefficient of variation. The coefficient of variation was lowest for data collected between 240 and 270  minutes after refreshing of the bedding material on the cubicles for both the standing index and rumination index, and for data collected between 120 and 150  minutes after refreshing of the bedding material on the cubicles for the cud chewing index. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of relative constant husbandry practices in a herd with an automatic milking system, the variation in the standing index, cud chewing index and rumination index was still considerable. This suggests these measures should be repeated on several consecutive days, according to population size and wanted margin of error, to be representative and useful.

26073555|t|Titanium(IV) in the Organic-Structure-Directing-Agent-Free Synthesis of Hydrophobic and Large-Pore Molecular Sieves as Redox Catalysts.
26073555|a|UNASSIGNED: Titanium(IV) incorporated into the framework of molecular sieves can be used as a highly active and sustainable catalyst for the oxidation of industrially important organic molecules. Unfortunately, the current process for the incorporation of titanium(IV) requires a large amount of expensive organic molecules used as organic-structure-directing agents (OSDAs), and this significantly increases the production costs and causes environmental problems owing to the removal of OSDAs by pyrolysis. Herein, an OSDA-free process was developed to incorporate titanium(IV) into BEA-type molecular sieves for the first time. More importantly, the hydrophobic environment and the robust, 3   D, and large pore structure of the titanium(IV)-incorporated molecular sieves fabricated from the OSDA-free process created a catalyst that was extremely active and selective for the epoxidation of bulky cyclooctene in comparison to Ti-incorporated BEA-type molecular sieves synthesized with OSDAs and commercial titanosilicate TS-1.

26073894|t|Genetic and chemical validation identifies Mycobacterium tuberculosis topoisomerase I as an attractive anti-tubercular target.
26073894|a|UNASSIGNED: DNA topoisomerases perform the essential function of maintaining DNA topology in prokaryotes. DNA gyrase, an essential enzyme that introduces negative supercoils, is a clinically validated target. However, topoisomerase I (Topo I), an enzyme responsible for DNA relaxation has received less attention as an antibacterial target, probably due to the ambiguity over its essentiality in many organisms. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome harbors a single topA gene with no obvious redundancy in its function suggesting an essential role. The topA gene could be inactivated only in the presence of a complementing copy of the gene in M.  tuberculosis. Furthermore, down-regulation of topA in a genetically engineered strain of M.  tuberculosis resulted in loss of bacterial viability which correlated with a concomitant depletion of intracellular Topo I levels. The topA knockdown strain of M.  tuberculosis failed to establish infection in a murine model of TB and was cleared from lungs in two months post infection. Phenotypic screening of a Topo I overexpression strain led to the identification of an inhibitor, thereby providing chemical validation of this target. Thus, our work confirms the attractiveness of Topo I as an anti-mycobacterial target.

26098452|t|The impact of biofuel poplar cultivation on ground-level ozone and premature human mortality depends on cultivar selection and planting location.
26098452|a|UNASSIGNED: Isoprene and other volatile organic compounds emitted from vegetation play a key role in governing the formation of ground-level ozone. Emission rates of such compounds depend critically on the plant species. Future land use change, driven by the cultivation of biofuel feedstocks, will change the distribution of plant species and hence the magnitude and distribution of emissions. Here we use relationships between biomass yield and isoprene emissions derived from experimental data for 29 commercially available poplar hybrids to assess the impact that the large-scale cultivation of poplar for use as a biofuel feedstock will have on air quality in Europe. We show that the increases in ground-level ozone across Europe will increase the number of premature deaths attributable to ozone pollution each year by up to 6%. Substantial crop losses (up to ~9 Mt y-1 of wheat and maize) are also projected. We further demonstrate that these impacts are strongly dependent on the location of the poplar plantations, due to the prevailing meteorology, the population density and the dominant crop type of the region. Our findings indicate the need for a concerted and centralized decision-making process that considers all aspects of future land use change in Europe, and not just the effect on greenhouse gas emissions.

26096779|t|The Casuarina NIN gene is transcriptionally activated throughout Frankia root infection as well as in response to bacterial diffusible signals.
26096779|a|UNASSIGNED: Root nodule symbioses (RNS) allow plants to acquire atmospheric nitrogen by establishing an intimate relationship with either rhizobia, the symbionts of legumes or Frankia in the case of actinorhizal plants. In legumes, NIN (Nodule INception) genes encode key transcription factors involved in nodulation. Here we report the characterization of CgNIN, a NIN gene from the actinorhizal tree Casuarina glauca using both phylogenetic analysis and transgenic plants expressing either ProCgNIN::reporter gene fusions or CgNIN RNAi constructs. We have found that CgNIN belongs to the same phylogenetic group as other symbiotic NIN genes and CgNIN is able to complement a legume nin mutant for the early steps of nodule development. CgNIN expression is correlated with infection by Frankia, including preinfection stages in developing root hairs, and is induced by culture supernatants. Knockdown mutants were impaired for nodulation and early root hair deformation responses were severely affected. However, no mycorrhizal phenotype was observed and no induction of CgNIN expression was detected in mycorrhizas. Our results indicate that elements specifically required for nodulation include NIN and possibly related gene networks derived from the nitrate signalling pathways.

26095967|a|UNASSIGNED: This article explores the medical conceptualization of the causes of diseases in nineteenth-century Colombia. It traces the history of some of the pathologies that were of major concern among nineteenth-century doctors: periodic fevers (yellow fever and malaria), continuous fevers (typhoid fever), and leprosy (Greek elephantiasis). By comparing the transforming conceptualizations of these diseases, this article shows that their changing pattern, the idea of climatic determinism of diseases (neo-Hippocratism and medical geography), the weak standing of the medical community in Colombian society, as well as Pasteurian germ practices were all crucial in the uneven and varied reshaping of their understanding.

26095230|t|Identification of North Sea molluscs with DNA barcoding.
26095230|a|UNASSIGNED: Sequence-based specimen identification, known as DNA barcoding, is a common method complementing traditional morphology-based taxonomic assignments. The fundamental resource in DNA barcoding is the availability of a taxonomically reliable sequence database to use as a reference for sequence comparisons. Here we provide a reference library including 579 sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) for 113 North Sea mollusc species. We tested the efficacy of this library by simulating a sequence-based specimen identification scenario using Best Match (BM), Best Close Match (BCM) and All Species Barcode (ASB) criteria with three different threshold values. Each identification result was compared with our prior morphology-based taxonomic assignments. Our simulation resulted in 87.7% congruent identifications (93.8% when excluding singletons). The highest number of congruent identifications was obtained with BCM and ASB and a 0.05 threshold. We also compared identifications with genetic clustering (BINs) computed by the Barcode of Life Datasystem (BOLD). About 68% of our morphological identifications were congruent with BINs created by BOLD. Forty-nine sequences were clustered in 16 discordant BINs, and these were divided in two classes: sequences from different species clustered in a single BIN; and conspecific sequences divided in more BINs. Whereas former incongruences were likely caused by BOLD entries in need of a taxonomic update, the latter incongruences regarded taxa requiring further investigations. These include species with amphi-Atlantic distribution, whose genetic structure should be evaluated over their entire range to produce a reliable sequence-based identification system.

26074469|t|Regeneration strategies of polymers employed in ex-situ remediation of contaminated soil: Bioregeneration versus solvent extraction.
26074469|a|UNASSIGNED: In this study we evaluated the feasibility of two regeneration strategies of contaminated polymers employed for ex-situ soil remediation in a two-step process. Soil decontamination is achieved by sorption of the pollutants on the polymer beads, which are regenerated in a subsequent step. Tested soil was contaminated with a mixture of 4-chlorophenol and pentachlorophenol, and a commercial polymer, Hytrel, has been employed for extraction. Removal efficiencies of the polymer-soil extraction are in the range of 51-97% for a contact time <=24  h. Two polymer regeneration strategies, solvent extraction and biological regeneration (realized in a two-phase partitioning bioreactor), were tested and compared. Performance was assessed in terms of removal rates and efficiencies and an economic analysis based on the operating costs has been performed. Results demonstrated the feasibility of both regeneration strategies, but the bioregeneration was advantageous in that provided the biodegradation of the contaminants desorbed from the polymer. Practically complete removal for 4-chlorophenol and up to 85% biodegradation efficiency for pentachlorophenol were achieved. Instead, in the solvent extraction, a relevant production (184-831  L  kgpol(-1)) of a highly polluted stream to be treated or disposed of is observed. The cost analysis of the two strategies showed that the bioregeneration is much more convenient with operating costs of    12    /kgpol i.e. more than one order of magnitude lower in comparison to    233    /kgpol of the solvent extraction.

26057699|t|Systemic regulation of photosynthetic function in field-grown sorghum.
26057699|a|UNASSIGNED: The photosynthetic characteristics of developing leaves of plants grown under artificial conditions are, to some extent, regulated systemically by mature leaves; however, whether systemic regulation of photosynthesis occurs in field-grown crops is unclear. To explore this question, we investigated the effects of planting density on growth characteristics, gas exchange, leaf nitrogen concentration and chlorophyll a fluorescence in field-grown sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). Our results showed that close planting resulted in a marked decline in light intensity in lower canopy. Sorghum plants grown at a high planting density had lower net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), and transpiration rate (E) than plants grown at a low planting density. Moreover, in the absence of mineral deficiency, close planting induced a slight increase in leaf nitrogen concentration. The decreased photosynthesis in leaves of the lower canopy at high planting density was caused mainly by the low light. However, newly developed leaves exposed to high light in the upper canopy of plants grown at high planting density also exhibited a distinct decline in photosynthesis relative to plants grown at low planting density. Based on these results, the photosynthetic function of the newly developed leaves in the upper canopy was not determined fully by their own high light environment. Accordingly, we suggest that the photosynthetic function of newly developed leaves in the upper canopy of field-grown sorghum plants is regulated systemically by the lower canopy leaves.

26013963|t|Oxytocin Stimulates Extracellular Ca(2+) Influx Through TRPV2 Channels in Hypothalamic Neurons to Exert Its Anxiolytic Effects.
26013963|a|UNASSIGNED: There is growing interest in anxiolytic and pro-social effects of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT), but the underlying intraneuronal mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we examined OXT-mediated anxiolysis in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of rats and effects of OXT administration on signaling events in hypothalamic primary and immortalized cells. In vivo, the application of SKF96365 prevented the anxiolytic activity of OXT in the PVN, suggesting that changes in intracellular Ca(2+) mediate the acute OXT behavioral effects. In vitro, mainly in the neurons with autonomous Ca(2+) oscillations, OXT increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and oscillation amplitude. Pharmacological intervention revealed OXT-dependent changes in Ca(2+) signaling that required activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid type-2 channel (TRPV2), mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase. TRPV2 induced the activation of the anxiolytic mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1/2). In situ, immunohistochemistry revealed co-localization of TRPV2 and OXT in the PVN. Thus, functional and pharmacological analyses identified TRPV2 as a mediator of anxiolytic effects of OXT, conveying the OXT signal to MEK1/2 via modulation of intracellular Ca(2+).Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 24 June 2015; doi:10.1038/npp.2015.147.

26115772|t|Classification and Tie2 mutations in spinal and soft tissue vascular anomalies.
26115772|a|UNASSIGNED: Vascular anomalies included hemangiomas and vascular malformations(VMs). VMs are mediated by mutations in the endothelial cell-specific receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 (TEK) ,which is essential for angiogenesis and vascular stabilization. We identified five types of Tie2 mutations in 80 patients with soft tissue or spinal VMs by PCR including the previously detected missense mutations 2690A>G (Y897C),2740C>T (L914F),2743C>T (R915C), and two nonsense mutation 2763G>A,2688C>T,we identified Tie2 mutation in primary spinal VMs for the first time.Tie2 mutations were found to be absent in 33 patients with hemangiomas and DNA samples of VMs. In addition, we showed that Tie2 mRNA expression in spinal VMs was similar to soft tissue VMs,but obviously lower than infant hemangiomas(P <0.01). This study provides new insights into spinal VMs,the association of Tie2 and vascular anomalies need to further discuss.

26117377|t|Does Intraoral Miniplate Fixation Have a Good Postoperative Stability After Sagittal Splitting Ramus Osteotomy? Comparison With Intraoral Bicortical Screw Fixation.
26117377|a|PURPOSE: Bicortical screw fixation systems and miniplate with monocortical screw fixation systems have been reported mainly in bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy (BSSO). This study compared postoperative stability between these 2 fixation systems by an intraoral approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. The study sample was composed of patients treated by BSSO at the authors' institute from January 2006 through December 2012. All cases had facial symmetry and were performed by setback surgery. The predictor variable was treatment group (intraoral screw fixation [SG] vs intraoral miniplate fixation [MG]), and the primary outcome variable was stability defined as the change in the position of point B. Other outcome variables were stability defined as the change in the position of the menton, blood loss, incidence of postoperative temporomandibular joint disorder, and nerve injury. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were computed and the P value was set at .05. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients (35 men and 40 women; mean age, 25.8  yr) were divided into 2 groups (39  SG cases and 36  MG cases). Postoperative changes at point B and the menton in the 2 fixation groups were not statistically different. Lingual nerve injury occurred only in SG cases. Moreover, total blood loss was greater in SG cases. CONCLUSION: An intraoral miniplate with monocortical screw fixation system is recommended over intraoral bicortical screw fixation for bone segments in setback BSSO in patients without facial asymmetry.

26045474|t|Cannabis, Cigarettes, and Their Co-Occurring Use: Disentangling Differences in Gray Matter Volume.
26045474|a|BACKGROUND: Structural magnetic resonance imaging techniques are powerful tools for examining the effects of drug use on the brain. The nicotine and cannabis literature has demonstrated differences between nicotine cigarette smokers and cannabis users compared to controls in brain structure; however, less is known about the effects of co-occurring cannabis and tobacco use. METHODS: We used voxel-based morphometry to examine gray matter volume differences between four groups: (1) cannabis-dependent individuals who do not smoke tobacco (Cs); (2) cannabis-dependent individuals who smoke tobacco (CTs); (3) cannabis-na  ve, nicotine-dependent individuals who smoke tobacco (Ts); and (4) healthy controls (HCs). We also explored associations between gray matter volume and measures of cannabis and tobacco use. RESULTS: A significant group effect was observed in the left putamen, thalamus, right precentral gyrus, and left cerebellum. Compared to HCs, the Cs, CTs, and Ts exhibited larger gray matter volumes in the left putamen. Cs also had larger gray matter volume than HCs in the right precentral gyrus. Cs and CTs exhibited smaller gray matter volume than HCs in the thalamus, and CTs and Ts had smaller left cerebellar gray matter volume than HCs. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends previous research that independently examined the effects of cannabis or tobacco use on brain structure by including an examination of co-occurring cannabis and tobacco use, and provides evidence that cannabis and tobacco exposure are associated with alterations in brain regions associated with addiction.

26013293|t|Novel Xylene-Linked Maltoside Amphiphiles (XMAs) for Membrane Protein Stabilisation.
26013293|a|UNASSIGNED: Membrane proteins are key functional players in biological systems. These biomacromolecules contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions and thus amphipathic molecules are necessary to extract membrane proteins from their native lipid environments and stabilise them in aqueous solutions. Conventional detergents are commonly used for membrane protein manipulation, but membrane proteins surrounded by these agents often undergo denaturation and aggregation. In this study, a novel class of maltoside-bearing amphiphiles, with a xylene linker in the central region, designated xylene-linked maltoside amphiphiles (XMAs) was developed. When these novel agents were evaluated with a number of membrane proteins, it was found that XMA-4 and XMA-5 have particularly favourable efficacy with respect to membrane protein stabilisation, indicating that these agents hold significant potential for membrane protein structural study.

26116449|t|Tumor necrosis factor-mediated downregulation of spinal astrocytic connexin43 leads to increased glutamatergic neurotransmission and neuropathic pain in mice.
26116449|a|UNASSIGNED: Spinal cord astrocytes are critical in the maintenance of neuropathic pain. Connexin 43 (Cx43) expressed on spinal dorsal horn astrocytes modulates synaptic neurotransmission, but its role in nociceptive transduction has yet to be fully elaborated. In mice, Cx43 is mainly expressed in astrocytes, not neurons or microglia, in the spinal dorsal horn. Hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity was observed beginning 3days after partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL), but a persistent downregulation of astrocytic Cx43 in ipsilateral lumbar spinal dorsal horn was not observed until 7days post-PSNL, suggesting that Cx43 downregulation mediates the maintenance and not the initiation of nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity. Downregulation of Cx43 expression by intrathecal treatment with Cx43 siRNA also induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Conversely, restoring Cx43 by an adenovirus vector expressing Cx43 (Ad-Cx43) ameliorated PSNL-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. The sensitized state following PSNL is likely maintained by dysfunctional glutamatergic neurotransmission, as Cx43 siRNA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity was attenuated with intrathecal treatment of glutamate receptor antagonists MK801 and CNQX, but not neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist CP96345 or the Ca(2+) channel subunit a2  1 blocker gabapentin. The source of this dysfunctional glutamatergic neurotransmission is likely decreased clearance of glutamate from the synapse rather than increased glutamate release into the synapse. Astrocytic expression of glutamate transporter GLT-1, but not GLAST, and activity of glutamate transport were markedly decreased in mice intrathecally injected with Cx43-targeting siRNA but not non-targeting siRNA. Glutamate release from spinal synaptosomes prepared from mice treated with either Cx43-targeting siRNA or non-targeting siRNA was unchanged. Intrathecal injection of Ad-Cx43 in PSNL mice restored astrocytic GLT-1 expression. The cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been implicated in the induction of central sensitization, particularly through its actions on astrocytes, in the spinal cord following peripheral injury. Intrathecal injection of TNF in na  ve mice induced the downregulation of both Cx43 and GLT-1 in spinal dorsal horn, as well as hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity, as observed in PSNL mice. Conversely, intrathecal treatment of PSNL mice with the TNF inhibitor etanercept prevented not only mechanical hypersensitivity but also the downregulation of Cx43 and GLT-1 expression in astrocytes. The current findings indicate that spinal astrocytic Cx43 are essential for the maintenance of neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury and suggest modulation of Cx43 as a novel target for developing analgesics for neuropathic pain.

26101802|t|Formation of Hydroxyapatite Skeletal Materials from Hydrogel Matrices via Artificial Biomineralization.
26101802|a|UNASSIGNED: Several kinds of hydrogel were prepared as mimics for the collagen/acidic protein hydrogel employed as the polymer matrix for mineralization in natural bone formation. The hydrogels prepared as mineralization matrices were employed for synthesizing artificial bones. The artificial bone made from a network of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) prepared by heating (PVA/PAA-h-network) exhibited mechanical properties comparable with those of fish scales. To elucidate the formation mechanism of the artificial bone, we synthesized four further kinds of matrix. Artificial bones were obtained from both a PVA/PAA network prepared by repeated freezing and thawing (PVA/PAA-ft-network) and a chitosan/PAA network, in which hydrogen bonding exists between the two constituent polymers, similarly to that observed in a natural collagen/acidic protein network. The artificial bone made from the chitosan/PAA network was confirmed to be formed by the phase transformation of a cartilaginous precursor by a process similar to the transformation of cartilaginous tissue to natural bone. In addition, skeletal phase material, i.e., a homogeneous solid phase of hydroxyapatite/polymers, was formed in the cartilaginous phase, i.e., the hypercomplex gel. The skeletal phase grew thicker at the expense of the cartilaginous phase until it formed the entirety of the composite. Artificial bones were also obtained from a gelatin/PAA network and a poly[N-(2-hydroxyethyl)acrylamide]-co-(acrylic acid) network. These experimental results suggested that the coexistence of proton donor and proton acceptor functions in the hydrogel is a key factor for bone formation. The hydroxyapatite content of our artificial bones was almost conterminous with those of natural bones.

26103568|t|Association Study of IL-12B Polymorphisms Susceptibility with Ankylosing Spondylitis in Mainland Han Population.
26103568|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether the genetic polymorphisms of IL-12B gene is a susceptibility factor to Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in mainland Han Chinese population. METHOD: Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10045431, rs11167764, rs3212227, rs6556412, rs6556416, rs6871626, rs6887695 and rs7709212) in the IL-12B gene were genotyped by iMLDR Assay technology in 400 patients [96% (384/400) HLA-B27(+)] and 395 geographically and ethnically matched healthy controls in mainland Han Chinese population. The correlation between IL-12B genetic polymorphisms and AS activity index (BASDAI, BASFI) were tested. RESULTS: The significant difference was found in genotype distribution between AS and healthy controls (  2 = 6.942, P-value = 0.031) of the SNP rs6871626. Furthermore, significant evidence was also detected under the recessive model for minor allele A. The AA genotype carrier had 1.830 fold risk compared with C allele carrier (with CC and AC genotypes) [OR (95% CI) = 1.830 (1.131-2.961), P-value = 0.014]. Nevertheless, the difference was no longer significant after Bonferroni correction. Subset analysis on cases with HLA-B27(+) did find the same results. Three genotypic groups (AA, CC and CA) in rs6871626 site was highly associated with the BASDAI and BASFI (P-value = 0.012 and P-value = 0.023, respectively), after adjustment for effect of age, sex, and disease duration, the P-value was 0.031 and 0.041, respectively. The AA genotype of rs6871626 was also significantly correlated with an increased BASDAI and BASFI compared to the AC and CC genotypes in AS patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that rs6871626 may be associated AS susceptibility and with disease activity (BASDAI, BASFI) in mainland Han Chinese population.

26100143|t|Primary Care Medication Safety Surveillance with Integrated Primary and Secondary Care Electronic Health Records: A Cross-Sectional Study.
26100143|a|INTRODUCTION: The extent of preventable medication-related hospital admissions and medication-related issues in primary care is significant enough to justify developing decision support systems for medication safety surveillance. The prerequisite for such systems is defining a relevant set of medication safety-related indicators and understanding the influence of both patient and general practice characteristics on medication prescribing and monitoring. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of linked primary and secondary care electronic health record data for surveillance of medication safety, examining not only prescribing but also monitoring, and associations with patient- and general practice-level characteristics. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using linked records of patients served by one hospital and over 50 general practices in Salford, UK. Statistical analysis consisted of mixed-effects logistic models, relating prescribing safety indicators to potential determinants. RESULTS: The overall prevalence (proportion of patients with at least one medication safety hazard) was 5.45  % for prescribing indicators and 7.65  % for monitoring indicators. Older patients and those on multiple medications were at higher risk of prescribing hazards, but at lower risk of missed monitoring. The odds of missed monitoring among all patients were 25  % less for males, 50  % less for patients in practices that provide general practitioner training, and threefold higher in practices serving the most deprived compared with the least deprived areas. Practices with more prescribing hazards did not tend to show more monitoring issues. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic collection, collation, and analysis of linked primary and secondary care records produce plausible and useful information about medication safety for a health system. Medication safety surveillance systems should pay close attention to patient age and polypharmacy with respect to both prescribing and monitoring failures; treat prescribing and monitoring as different statistical processes, rather than a combined measure of prescribing safety; and audit the socio-economic equity of missed monitoring.

26100299|t|Long-term clinical outcomes of combined BPTB ACL reconstruction and popliteus tendon plasty.
26100299|a|PURPOSE: A deficiency of posterolateral structures significantly increases the varus load on the ACL, while a chronic ACL lesion, the increased tibial rotation and the repetitive non-physiological knee motion, could affect and damage the integrity of the popliteus tendon. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to report the very long clinical outcomes of a combined single-bundle BPTB ACL reconstruction and popliteus plasty according to Bousquets technique, for the treatment of combined chronic anterior and posterolateral laxities. METHODS: Fifteen patients that underwent combined ACL reconstruction and popliteal plasty according to Bousquets technique were available at mean 26.8      1.0  years (range 25.4-28.0  years). All the patients were evaluated clinically and 13 by means of KT-1000 Arthrometer as well. Subjective evaluation was performed with the subjective IKDC, WOMAC and a 0-10 VAS for pain scales. RESULTS: At clinical evaluation, 10 patients (67  %) presented a negative anterior drawer test; Lachman test was negative in nine patients (60  %); the varus stress test was negative in eight (53  %); and the dial test was negative in all but one patient (93  %). Only two patients (15  %) presented a side-to-side difference >5  mm at the instrumented laxity evaluation. CONCLUSION: The combined single-bundle BPTB ACL reconstruction and popliteal plasty according to Bousquets technique were able to produce very good long-term results, in terms of knee stability, subjective outcomes, functional results and return to sport activity, in case of chronic anterior and posterolateral laxities. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Retrospective case series, Level IV.

26100088|t|Duration of wheezy episodes in early childhood is independent of the microbial trigger.
26100088|a|BACKGROUND: Wheezy episodes in young children are often triggered by viral and bacterial respiratory tract infections, but there is little evidence supporting the hypothesis that symptom duration depends on the specific microbial trigger. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate whether the duration of wheezy episodes in young children depends on the microbial trigger. METHODS: Two hundred eighty-three children from the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood2000 at-risk birth cohort were prospectively examined for common airway pathogenic bacteria and viruses during acute wheezy episodes in the first 3  years of life. Findings were related to symptomatic duration of episodes, as monitored in daily diary cards from birth. RESULTS: Eight hundred thirty-seven samples were investigated for viruses, bacteria, or both. Both viruses and bacteria were identified in 55% of episodes, bacteria were identified exclusively in 31% of episodes, and viruses were identified exclusively in 10% of episodes. The median duration of acute symptoms was 9  days (interquartile range, 5-16  days), and duration was independent of bacterial or viral species. CONCLUSIONS: The duration of wheezy episodes was independent of pathogenic airway bacterial or viral species. This suggests that symptom burden from infections is dependent on other factors, such as environmental exposures or host factors. The common term viral wheeze seems inappropriate in view of  the  finding of pathogenic bacteria in 86% of wheezy episodes.

26099806|t|In vivo porcine lipopolysaccharide inflammation models to study immunomodulation of drugs.
26099806|a|UNASSIGNED: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a structural part of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is one of the most effective stimulators of the immune system and has been widely applied in pigs as an experimental model for bacterial infection. For this purpose, a variety of Escherichia coli serotypes, LPS doses, routes and duration of administration have been used. LPS administration induces the acute phase response (APR) and is associated with dramatic hemodynamic, clinical and behavioral changes in pigs. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 are involved in the induction of the eicosanoid pathway and the hepatic production of acute phase proteins, including C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin (Hp) and pig major acute phase protein (pig-MAP). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) play a major role in the development of fever and pulmonary hypertension in LPS-challenged pigs, respectively. The LPS-induced APR can be modulated by drugs. Steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ((N)SAIDs) possess anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties through (non)-selective central and peripheral cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. Antimicrobial drugs, especially macrolide antibiotics, which are commonly used in veterinary medicine for the treatment of bacterial respiratory diseases, have been recurrently reported to exert clinically important immunomodulatory effects in human and murine research. To investigate the influence of these drugs on the clinical response, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins (APP) and the course of the febrile response in pigs, in vivo LPS inflammation models can be applied. Yet, to date, in vivo research on the immunomodulatory properties of antimicrobial drugs in these models in pigs is largely lacking. This review provides acritical overview of the use of in vivo porcine E. coli LPS inflammation models for the study of the APR, as well as the potential immunomodulatory properties of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial drugs in pigs.

26048700|t|The difference between energy consumption and energy cost: Modelling energy tariff structures for water resource recovery facilities.
26048700|a|UNASSIGNED: The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of incorporating more realistic energy cost models (based on current energy tariff structures) into existing water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) process models when evaluating technologies and cost-saving control strategies. In this paper, we first introduce a systematic framework to model energy usage at WRRFs and a generalized structure to describe energy tariffs including the most common billing terms. Secondly, this paper introduces a detailed energy cost model based on a Spanish energy tariff structure coupled with a WRRF process model to evaluate several control strategies and provide insights into the selection of the contracted power structure. The results for a 1-year evaluation on a 115,000 population-equivalent WRRF showed monthly cost differences ranging from 7 to 30% when comparing the detailed energy cost model to an average energy price. The evaluation of different aeration control strategies also showed that using average energy prices and neglecting energy tariff structures may lead to biased conclusions when selecting operating strategies or comparing technologies or equipment. The proposed framework demonstrated that for cost minimization, control strategies should be paired with a specific optimal contracted power. Hence, the design of operational and control strategies must take into account the local energy tariff.

26024055|t|Possible deleterious hormonal changes associated with low-sodium diets.
26024055|a|The average salt intake of people in Canada, the United States, and Europe is about 3,400 mg of sodium per day, which exceeds the recommended intake levels set by various health organizations. The World Health Organization recommends a worldwide reduction of sodium intake to less than 2,000 mg per day. Most research to date has focused on the negative effects of high-sodium intake; however, little information is available on the metabolic effects of low-sodium intakes. This review focuses on the hormonal changes associated with low-sodium diets, especially the hormones involved in metabolism and cardiovascular and renal function. Based largely on rodent studies, low-sodium diets have been associated with changes in glycemic control, energy metabolism, cardiovascular disease risk, cholesterol concentrations, inflammation, and functioning of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Overall, research has revealed mixed results regarding the impact of dietary sodium intake on various hormones. Further research is required to assess the effects of sodium reduction on hormones and their associated pathways in order to determine the likelihood of any unintended effects.

26045324|t|Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Macrosomia: A Literature Review.
26045324|a|BACKGROUND: Fetal macrosomia, defined as a birth weight >= 4,000 g, may affect 12% of newborns of normal women and 15-45% of newborns of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The increased risk of macrosomia in GDM is mainly due to the increased insulin resistance of the mother. In GDM, a higher amount of blood glucose passes through the placenta into the fetal circulation. As a result, extra glucose in the fetus is stored as body fat causing macrosomia, which is also called 'large for gestational age'. This paper reviews studies that explored the impact of GDM and fetal macrosomia as well as macrosomia-related complications on birth outcomes and offers an evaluation of maternal and fetal health. SUMMARY: Fetal macrosomia is a common adverse infant outcome of GDM if unrecognized and untreated in time. For the infant, macrosomia increases the risk of shoulder dystocia, clavicle fractures and brachial plexus injury and increases the rate of admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit. For the mother, the risks associated with macrosomia are cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage and vaginal lacerations. Infants of women with GDM are at an increased risk of becoming overweight or obese at a young age (during adolescence) and are more likely to develop type II diabetes later in life. Besides, the findings of several studies that epigenetic alterations of different genes of the fetus of a GDM mother in utero could result in the transgenerational transmission of GDM and type II diabetes are of concern.    2015 S.

26047736|t|Effect of separation distance on the growth and differentiation of mouse embryoid bodies in micropatterned cultures.
26047736|a|UNASSIGNED: Embryoid body (EB) culture has been widely used for in  vitro differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Micropatterning of cultures is a promising technique for regulating EB development, because it allows for controlling the EB size and the distance between neighboring EBs. In this study, we examined the relationship of EB separation distance to their growth and differentiation using a micropatterned chip. The basic chip design consisted of 91 gelatin spots (300   m in diameter) in a hexagonal arrangement on a glass substrate that served as the cell adhesion area; the region without gelatin spots was modified with polyethylene glycol to create the non-adhesion area. Two similar chips were fabricated with distances between gelatin spots of 500 and 1500   m. Mouse ES cells adhered on the gelatin spots and then proliferated to form EBs. When the EB-EB distance was at 1500   m, their size and the expression of developmental gene markers were almost the same for all EBs on the chip. This indicated that interference between neighboring EBs was avoided. In contrast, when the EB-EB distance was at 500   m, the size of EBs located in the inside region of the chip was smaller than that in the outside region. Additionally, in the inside region, hepatic differentiation of EB cells was increased over cardiac and vascular differentiation. These results indicate that the distance between EBs is an important factor in the regulation of their growth and differentiation.

26048182|t|Polyelectrolyte-mediated increase of biofilm mass formation.
26048182|a|BACKGROUND: Biofilm formation is associated with various aspects of bacterial and fungal infection. This study was designed to assess the impact of diverse natural polyelectrolytes, such as DNA, F-actin, neurofilaments (NFs), vimentin and purified Pf1 bacteriophage on biofilm formation and swarming motility of select pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa associated with lung infections in CF patients. RESULTS: The bacteriophage Pf1 (1  mg/ml) significantly increased biofilm mass produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa P14, Escherichia coli RS218 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. DNA, F-actin, NFs and Pf1 also increased biofilm mass of the fungal C. albicans 1409 strain. Addition of F-actin, DNA or Pf1 bacteriophage to 0.5% agar plates increased swarming motility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Xen5. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of polyelectrolytes at infection sites is likely to promote biofilm growth and bacterial swarming.

26096278|t|A Turkish translation of the Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire (NOSQ-2002/LONG) adapted for young workers in high-risk jobs.
26096278|a|BACKGROUND: Occupational skin diseases (OSDs) represent 10-40% of all occupational diseases in many industrialized countries. Young workers are frequently exposed to toxic substances and chemicals in the workplace. The occupational conditions of young workers can impose a high level of risk for the occurrence of OSDs. The Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire (NOSQ-2002) was developed in English as a new, comprehensive, standardized tool with which to screen for OSDs. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to translate the NOSQ-2002 into Turkish and to culturally adapt the long version of the instrument for use with young workers in jobs with high risk for the occurrence of OSDs. METHODS: Forward and back translations were carried out. Problematic items were modified until the Turkish-language version achieved a satisfactory consensus with the original version of the NOSQ-2002. The final Turkish version was tested in 40 randomly selected young workers with and without OSDs who were studying in the fields of hairdressing, jewelry making, and car mechanics at vocational training schools run by the National Education Ministry. RESULTS: When the original questionnaire had been translated into the target language, a first consensus version was evaluated by an expert panel. The expert panel determined that 36 questions (63.2%) in the Turkish version required some level of modification in order to facilitate clear understanding. Cognitive interviews were then performed. After some modification, the final Turkish version was established and tested among young workers. CONCLUSIONS: The new Turkish version of the NOSQ is a comprehensible, reliable, and useful tool that can be applied to young workers in specific occupations.

26090408|t|Iron-Binding Protein Degradation by Cysteine Proteases of Naegleria fowleri.
26090408|a|Naegleria fowleri causes acute and fulminant primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. This microorganism invades its host by penetrating the olfactory mucosa and then traveling up the mesaxonal spaces and crossing the cribriform plate; finally, the trophozoites invade the olfactory bulbs. During its invasion, the protozoan obtains nutrients such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and cationic ions (e.g., iron, calcium, and sodium) from the host. However, the mechanism by which these ions are obtained, particularly iron, is poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of N. fowleri to degrade iron-binding proteins, including hololactoferrin, transferrin, ferritin, and hemoglobin. Zymography assays were performed for each substrate under physiological conditions (pH 7 at 37  C) employing conditioned medium (CM) and total crude extracts (TCEs) of N. fowleri. Different degradation patterns with CM were observed for hololactoferrin, transferrin, and hemoglobin; however, CM did not cause ferritin degradation. In contrast, the TCEs degraded only hololactoferrin and transferrin. Inhibition assays revealed that cysteine proteases were involved in this process. Based on these results, we suggest that CM and TCEs of N. fowleri degrade iron-binding proteins by employing cysteine proteases, which enables the parasite to obtain iron to survive while invading the central nervous system.

26091015|t|Deprotonation in Mixed-Valent Diiron(II,III) Complexes with Aniline or Benzimidazole Ligands.
26091015|a|UNASSIGNED: We have previously investigated cis/trans isomerization processes in phenoxido-bridged mixed-valent Fe(II)Fe(III) complexes that contain either one aniline or one anilide ligand. In this work, we compare the properties of similar complexes bearing one terminal protic ligand, either aniline or 1H-benzimidazole. Whatever the ligand, (1)H NMR spectroscopy clearly evidences that the complexes are present in CH3CN as a mixture of cis- and trans-isomers in a close to 1:1 ratio. We show here that addition of NEt3 indeed allows the deprotonation of these ligands, the resulting complexes bearing either anilide or benzimidazolide that are coordinated to the ferric site. The latter are singular examples of a high-spin ferric ion coordinated to a benzimidazolide ligand. Whereas the trans-isomer of the anilide complex is the overwhelming species, benzimidazolide species are mixtures of cis- and trans-isomers in equal proportions. Moreover, cyclic voltammametry studies show that Fe(III)Fe(III) complexes with 1H-benzimidazole are more stable than their aniline counterparts, whereas the reverse is observed for the deprotonated species.

26029908|t|Anterior Segment Neovascularization in Diabetic Retinopathy: A Masquerade.
26029908|a|PURPOSE: Anterior segment neovascularization (ASNV) could be a masquerade for ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS) in diabetic patients which misleads diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of our study is to find the relationship between blood flow velocity in carotid siphon and the development of ASNV in diabetic. METHODS: We reviewed 34 eyes of 17 diabetic patients who had Transcranial Color Doppler (TCD) examination with unilateral ASNV. The circulatory parameters of both eyes of each patient were compared and analyzed. In addition, 9 patients with more than 50% stenosis of extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) and low velocity flow through TCD had been treated by carotid revascularization surgery. RESULTS: The maximal velocity in systole (Vmax) of carotid siphon (SCA) was lower in the eyes with ASNV than in the eyes without ASNV (P<0.05). ASNV of all the 9 patients regressed totally and BCVA improved significantly (P<0.05). Stenosis of ICA and arm-retina time (ART) decreased significantly (P<0.01) and SCA and ophthalmic artery (OA) increased significantly (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed ASNV could be a masquerade for OIS in patients with diabetic retinopathy. The decreased blood flow velocity in carotid siphon is related to the development of ASNV. Circulatory parameters screening of SCA by TCD is important to help us to evaluate the blood flow in SCA, the possibility of development of ASNV, and the prognosis of the patient. Interference such as carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) can be performed if necessary to improve the blood flow in SCA and make ASNV regression.

26111502|t|Decisions, choice and shared decision making in antenatal clinics: An observational study.
26111502|a|OBJECTIVE: The UK Government has prioritised shared decision making (SDM) and choice in maternity services, but no studies have explored the breadth of antenatal decisions or the feasibility of this aspiration. This study aimed to describe the decisions made, investigate the factors associated with choice and explore SDM practice. METHODS: Cross-sectional audio-recording of consultations in a UK district general hospital. Multi-level regression models were used to investigate associations between choice and doctor, patient, consultation and decision variables. RESULTS: 585 decisions were documented with a mean of 3.0 (SD 1.5) per consultation. No choice was offered in 75% of decisions. Choice was associated with the decision topic, consultation length, Royal College membership status and presence on the specialist register. CONCLUSIONS: Without a choice, it will be challenging for a patient and their healthcare profession to truly share decisions. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: If universal SDM is the aim, then further work is required to understand the factors impacting choice availability and SDM, while engaging and supporting healthcare professionals to offer options and share decisions with patients.

26095119|t|Metabolic effects of non-nutritive sweeteners.
26095119|a|UNASSIGNED: Until recently, the general belief was that non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) were healthy sugar substitutes because they provide sweet taste without calories or glycemic effects. However, data from several epidemiological studies have found that consumption of NNSs, mainly in diet sodas, is associated with increased risk to develop obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. The main purpose of this article is to review recent scientific evidence supporting potential mechanisms that explain how "metabolically inactive" NNSs, which have few, if any, calories, might promote metabolic dysregulation. Three potential mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive, are presented: 1) NNSs interfere with learned responses that contribute to control glucose and energy homeostasis, 2) NNSs interfere with gut microbiota and induce glucose intolerance, and 3) NNSs interact with sweet-taste receptors expressed throughout the digestive system that play a role in glucose absorption and trigger insulin secretion. In addition, recent findings from our laboratory showing an association between individual taste sensitivity to detect sucralose and sucralose's acute effects on metabolic response to an oral glucose load are reported. Taken as a whole, data support the notion that NNSs have metabolic effects. More research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which NNSs may drive metabolic dysregulation and better understand potential effects of these commonly used food additives.

26045276|t|Genetic contributors and modifiers of biliary atresia.
26045276|a|To date, the etiology and pathogenic underpinning of the progression of the most prevalent serious neonatal liver disease, biliary atresia, remains elusive. This disease presents as an aggressive form of neonatal cholestasis characterized by the destruction and obliteration of the extrahepatic bile ducts within the first few weeks of life and a rapid progression of biliary fibrosis, likely due to unremitting cholestasis and retention of biliary constituents including bile acids. In    5% of patients, biliary atresia is associated with laterality features, suggesting a genetic underpinning to a disease that begins soon after birth. However, biliary atresia does not occur within families and twins are discordant, indicating an absence of strict mendelian inheritance. Despite this, genes related to bile duct dysmorphogenesis/ciliopathies overlapping with features of biliary atresia in both humans and nonhuman model systems have been proposed. Taken together, strict genetic etiologies leading to a common pathway of a neonatal cholangiopathy resulting in biliary atresia remain elusive. Contributions from fibrogenesis- and inflammation-based studies suggest that early engagement of these pathways contributes to disease progression, but a recent double-blind study did not suggest any benefit from early use of corticosteroids. However, there are genetic contributions to the adaptation and response to cholangiopathies and cholestasis that may be present in certain populations that likely impact upon the response to hepatoportoenterostomy and subsequent biliary tract function. Studies utilizing next generation sequencing technologies (e.g., exome analysis) are ongoing in several laboratories around the world; they are expected to provide insights into genetic contributions to biliary atresia outcomes. Altogether, combinations of exome sequencing and large population studies are expected to reveal causative and modifying genes relevant to patients with biliary atresia as a means to provide therapeutic targets and potential opportunities for genetic screening.    2015 S.

26104081|t|Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck: Comparison of Diffusion-weighted MRI at b-values of 1,000 and 2,000 s/mm(2) to Predict Response to Induction Chemotherapy.
26104081|a|PURPOSE: Recent publications have reported contradictory results of pretreatment diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) for the prediction of chemoradiotherapeutic response in primary squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC). Therefore, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of DWI obtained with both standard (b = 0 and 1,000 s/mm(2)) and high (b = 0 and 2,000 s/mm(2)) b-values for predicting response to induction chemotherapy in HNSCCs. METHODS: For 25 patients with primary HNSCC who underwent DWI with both standard and high b-values prior to treatment, we calculated corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Regions of interest containing the tumor were drawn on every section of ADC maps and summated to make volume-based data of the entire tumor. Histogram parameters (mean ADC, kurtosis, and skewness) were correlated with treatment response using unpaired Student t test. Univariate and multivariate analysis of the ADC parameters, patient age, sex, whole tumor volume, and T stage were also performed to predict tumor response to induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: Response to induction chemotherapy was good in 13 of the 25 patients and poor in 12. The mean ADC values of good responders at standard b-value (ADC1000), 1.23    0.34 (* 10(-3) mm(2)/s), and high b-value (ADC2000), 0.62    0.14 (* 10(-3) mm(2)/s), were lower than those of poor responders (ADC1000, 1.32    0.28 [* 10(-3) mm(2)/s]; ADC2000, 0.76    0.15 [* 10(-3) mm(2)/s]), but significant difference was achieved only at the ADC2000 map (P = 0.02). In addition, mean tumor volume prior to treatment of good responders was smaller than that of poor responders. However, at multiple logistic regression analysis, only the mean ADC2000 value remained as a significant predictor of response to induction chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: DWI with high b-values (b = 0 and 2,000 s/mm(2)) as an assessment of ADC values may help predict tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for primary HNSCCs.

26044498|t|Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in older infants and young children in China who are naive to pneumococcal vaccination: Results of a phase 4 open-label trial.
26044498|a|BACKGROUND: This postlicensure study was conducted to assess immunogenicity and safety of PCV7 catch-up regimens in previously unvaccinated older infants and young children in China. METHODS: Healthy children 121 days to <72 months were grouped by age and immunized with 1 of 4 PCV7 dosing regimens. Serotype-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and percentage of subjects with IgG>= 0.35 g/mL were assessed before vaccination and 1 and 12 months postvaccination. The incidence of clinically important adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), AEs leading to study withdrawal, and protocol-related AEs were assessed throughout the study. RESULTS: Prevaccination serotype-specific GMCs were generally low in subjects <24 months; the majority of children 24 to <72 months had IgG concentrations >= 0.35 g/mL. One month postvaccination, GMCs were similar across groups for the 7 PCV serotypes, ranging from 3.95 to 13.02 g/mL; the highest antibody levels were observed for serotype 14. Regardless of dosing regimen, >90% of subjects had IgG>= 0.35 g/mL for each PCV serotype. At 12-month follow-up, IgG GMCs ranged from 0.65 to 5.19, and all remained above prevaccination IgG GMC; >70% of subjects had IgG>= 0.35 g/mL. Older children generally had the most robust immune response both at 1 month postvaccination and during 12-month follow-up. PCV7 was well tolerated. Pyrexia, which was mild to moderate in severity, was the most common AE. Two subjects reported SAEs (n=4), and there was 1 study withdrawal; none of these were considered treatment related. CONCLUSION: In China, PCV7 catch-up vaccinations given to older infants and young children naive to pneumococcal vaccines resulted in a robust immune response to all serotypes; this response persisted after 1 year. PCV7 was well tolerated in Chinese infants and children.

26049953|t|Injectable agents for pre-exposure prophylaxis: lessons learned from contraception to inform HIV prevention.
26049953|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Long-acting injectable (LAI) forms of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are in clinical trials, generating much hope for HIV prevention. But this is not the first time that an injectable form of preventive medication has emerged: the contraceptive agent depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) has an important precedent. DMPA's long journey, its initial reception, and ongoing implementation challenges can help inform the field of HIV prevention as we plan for approval, acceptance, and scale-up of LAI-PrEP. RECENT FINDINGS: DMPA faced a long regulatory journey in the USA, with a lag of 25 years from initial application (1967) to approval (1992). Acceptance after introduction was rapid, but challenges hampered scale-up. Specific lessons learned include that extensive acceptability work is needed in parallel to product development. Also, low continuation rates, challenges with timing of initiation, and difficulty ensuring access for the most vulnerable populations have limited DMPA's impact. A new subcutaneous formulation presents opportunities for administration outside of clinical settings and for self-administration. SUMMARY: Those involved in LAI-PrEP development and those who plan to be involved in its future implementation must consider these lessons and possible solutions from DMPA to ensure a successful future for this new HIV prevention modality.

26100296|t|Visceral adipose tissue measured by computed tomography and high-grade prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.
26100296|a|UNASSIGNED: We assessed the association between obesity measurements including visceral adipose tissue (VAT), measured by computed tomography, and the risk of high-grade prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. We investigated 296 patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent radical prostatectomy. Data extracted from medical records included age, body mass index (BMI), VAT, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen levels, and Gleason score (GS). We performed logistic regression to examine the association between indicators of obesity and a higher GS (   4+3). Among the 296 patients, 107 (36%) had a higher GS. After controlling for age and prostate-specific antigen, BMI was not associated with GS (odds ratio, OR=1.039, 95% confidence interval, CI=0.943-1.145; P=0.437). BMI had different effects on GS depending on VAT. When the data were stratified by the median VAT value, a higher BMI was significantly associated with a higher GS in patients with VAT   130.5   cm(2) (OR=1.218, 95% CI=1.028-1.443; P=0.022), but not in those with VAT<130.5   cm(2) (OR=0.91(2), 95% CI=0.783-1.062; P=0.236). A higher BMI was associated with an increased risk of high-grade cancer only in patients with more VAT.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 23 June 2015. doi:10.1038/ijo.2015.111.

26099879|t|NextGen(  ) Home Sperm Banking Kit: Outcomes of Offsite vs Onsite Collection-Preliminary Findings.
26099879|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare cryosurvival rates between remote collections with NextGen kit (offsite) and onsite collection of semen samples from infertile men and those with cancer. METHODS: Prefreeze and post-thaw sperm motility, total motile sperm, and percent cryosurvival rates were compared between samples collected from infertile men onsite at the Andrology Center (n  = 10) and samples collected from infertile patients at home (offsite; n  = 9), which were shipped by NextGen to our laboratory. A second group (n  = 17) consisted of 10 semen samples from cancer patients collected onsite, which were compared with 7 semen samples from cancer patients shipped by the NextGen. All semen samples were assessed within 18  hours of collection. RESULTS: In the infertile men, percent cryosurvival rates were similar with NextGen compared with those of onsite collection (53.14    28.9% vs 61.90    20.46%; P  = .51). Similarly, in the cancer patients, all 4 parameters were comparable between the onsite and NextGen. Cryosurvival rates were also similar between NextGen compared with those of onsite collection (52.71    20.37% vs 58.90    22.68%; P  = .46). CONCLUSION: Cancer patients can bank sperm as effectively as men banking for infertility reasons using the NextGen kit.

26007221|t|Impact of a simulation training curriculum on technical and nontechnical skills in colonoscopy: a randomized trial.
26007221|a|BACKGROUND: GI endoscopy simulation-based training augments early clinical performance; however, the optimal manner by which to deliver training is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to validate a simulation-based structured comprehensive curriculum (SCC) designed to teach technical, cognitive, and integrative competencies in colonoscopy. DESIGN: Single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Endoscopic simulation course at an academic hospital. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Thirty-three novice endoscopists were allocated to an SCC group or self-regulated learning (SRL) group. The SCC group received a curriculum consisting of 6 hours of didactic lectures and 8 hours of virtual reality simulation-based training with expert feedback. The SRL group was provided a list of  desired objectives and was instructed to practice on the simulator for an equivalent time (8 hours). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Clinical transfer was assessed during 2 patient colonoscopies using the Joint  Advisory Group Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (JAG DOPS) scale. Secondary outcome measures included differences in procedural knowledge, immediate post-training simulation performance, and delayed post-training (4-6 weeks) performance during an integrated scenario test on the JAG DOPS communication and integrated scenario global rating scales. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in baseline or post-training performance on the simulator task. The SCC group performed superiorly during their first and second clinical colonoscopies. Additionally, the SCC group demonstrated significantly better knowledge and colonoscopy-specific performance, communication, and global performance during the integrated scenario. LIMITATIONS: We were unable to measure SRL participants' effort outside of mandatory training. In addition, feedback metrics and number of available simulation cases are limited. CONCLUSIONS: These results support integration of endoscopy simulation into a structured curriculum incorporating instructional feedback and complementary didactic knowledge as a means to augment technical, cognitive, and integrative skills acquisition, as compared with SRL on virtual reality simulators. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT01991522.).

26009935|a|UNASSIGNED: Surgical site infections following the implantation of intrathecal drug delivery systems typically present during the first 1 to 2  months following surgery. Surgical site infections occurring outside of this window are rare entities and require special attention to identify the source or underlying cause. In this report, we present a case of pump pocket infection 18  months following implantation due to an asymptomatic and unrecognized bowel injury associated with the catheter. This case highlights the need for a thorough evaluation in a patient with suspected infections more than 2  months after surgery to ensure adequate treatment.

26073201|t|Short-term exposure to noise, fine particulate matter and nitrogen oxides on ambulatory blood pressure: A repeated-measure study.
26073201|a|UNASSIGNED: Exposure to road traffic noise, fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter  <=2.5 m; PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) has been associated with transient changes in blood pressure, but whether an interaction exists remains unclear. This panel study investigated whether noise, PM2.5 and NOx exposure were independently associated with changes in 24-h ambulatory blood pressure. We recruited 33 males and 33 females aged 18-32 years as study subjects. Personal noise exposure and ambulatory blood pressure were monitored simultaneously in 2007. During the data collection periods, 24-h data on PM2.5 and NOx from five air-quality monitors within 6km of participants' home addresses were used to estimate their individual exposures. Linear mixed-effects regression models were used to estimate single and combined effects on ambulatory blood pressure. Exposure to both noise and PM2.5 was significantly associated with increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) over 24h; NOx exposure was only significantly related to elevated DBP. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure increased with the current noise exposure of 5 A-weighted decibels (dBA) (SBP 1.44 [95% confidence interval: 1.16, 1.71]mmHg and DBP 1.40 [1.18, 1.61]mmHg) and PM2.5 exposure of 10-  g/m(3) (SBP 0.81 [0.19, 1.43]mmHg and DBP 0.63 [0.17, 1.10]mmHg), as well as the current NOx exposure of 10-ppb (DBP 0.54 [0.12, 0.97]mmHg) after simultaneous adjustment. These findings suggest that exposure to noise and air pollutants may independently increase ambulatory blood pressure and the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

26074051|t|Peripheral blood stem cell mobilization failure.
26074051|a|UNASSIGNED: Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an important and often life saving treatment for many hematological malignancies and selected solid tumors. To rescue hematopoiesis after high-dose chemotherapy in autologous HSCT depends on maintaining sufficient stem cells. Hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells expressing CD34 in the BM are mobilized into the circulation with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor        chemotherapy prior to autologous HSCT. One of the most important factors for success of autologous HSCT is hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) count. Minimum threshold for the engraftment of hematopoietic cells is accepted as 2   *   10(6) CD34   +   cells/kg especially for platelet engraftment. Below this level it is defined as stem cell mobilization failure. There are several factors affecting stem cell mobilization: prior chemotherapy (such as fludarabine, melphalan, lenalidomide) and radiotherapy, age, type of disease, bone marrow cellularity. We tried to summarize the reasons of peripheral stem cell mobilization failure.

26096748|a|UNASSIGNED: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is part of the electromagnetic spectrum emitted naturally from the sun or from artificial sources such as tanning devices. Acute skin reactions induced by UVR exposure are erythema (skin reddening), or sunburn, and the acquisition of a suntan triggered by UVR-induced DNA damage. UVR exposure is the main cause of skin cancer, including cutaneous malignant melanoma, basal-cell carcinoma, and squamous-cell carcinoma. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in fair-skinned populations, and its incidence has increased steeply over recent decades. According to estimates for 2012, about 100,000 new cases of cutaneous melanoma and about 22,000 deaths from it occurred in Europe. The main mechanisms by which UVR causes cancer are well understood. Exposure during childhood appears to be particularly harmful. Exposure to UVR is a risk factor modifiable by individuals' behaviour. Excessive exposure from natural sources can be avoided by seeking shade when the sun is strongest, by wearing appropriate clothing, and by appropriately applying sunscreens if direct sunlight is unavoidable. Exposure from artificial sources can be completely avoided by not using sunbeds. Beneficial effects of sun or UVR exposure, such as for vitamin D production, can be fully achieved while still avoiding too much sun exposure and the use of sunbeds. Taking all the scientific evidence together, the recommendation of the 4th edition of the European Code Against Cancer for ultraviolet radiation is: "Avoid too much sun, especially for children. Use sun protection. Do not use sunbeds."

26011197|t|Perioperative Allogeneic Blood Transfusion Is Associated With Surgical Site Infection After Abdominoperineal Resection-a Space for the Implementation of Patient Blood Management Strategies.
26011197|a|UNASSIGNED: Allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT) has been reported as a major risk factor for surgical site infection (SSI) in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. However, the association of ABT with SSI in patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection (APR) and total pelvic exenteration (TPE) still remains to be evaluated. Here, we aim to elucidate this association. The medical records of all patients undergoing APR and TPE at our institution in the period between January 2000 and December 2012 were reviewed. Patients without SSI (no SSI group) were compared with patients who developed SSI (SSI group), in terms of clinicopathologic features, including ABT. In addition, data for 262 patients who underwent transabdominal rectal resection at our institution in the same period were also enrolled, and their data on differential leukocyte counts were evaluated. Multivariate analysis showed that intraoperative transfusion was an independent predictive factor for SSI after APR and TPE (P = 0.004). In addition, the first-operative day lymphocyte count of patients undergoing APR, TPE, and transabdominal rectal resection was significantly higher in nontransfusion patients compared with transfusion ones (P = 0.026). ABT in the perioperative period of APR and TPE may have an important immunomodulatory effect, leading to an increased incidence of SSI. This fact should be carefully considered, and efforts to avoid allogeneic blood exposure while still achieving adequate patient blood management would be very important for patients undergoing APR and TPE as well.

26008616|t|Low Yield of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Screening in Hemodialysis Patients: 10 Years' Experience.
26008616|a|UNASSIGNED: OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal colonization in hemodialysis patients and to analyze the cost-effectiveness of our screening approach compared with an alternative strategy. DESIGN Screening study and cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS Analysis of twice-yearly MRSA prevalence studies conducted in the hemodialysis unit of a 950-bed tertiary care hospital from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2013. For this purpose, nasal swab samples were cultured on MRSA screening agar (mannitol-oxacillin biplate). RESULTS There were 20 mass screenings during the 10-year study period. We identified 415 patients participating in at least 1 screening, with an average of 4.5 screenings per patient. Of 415 screened patients, 15 (3.6%) were found to be MRSA carriers. The first mass screening in 2004 yielded the highest percentage of MRSA (6/101 [6%]). Only 7 subsequent screenings revealed new MRSA carriers, whereas 4 screenings confirmed previously known carriers, and 8 remained negative. None of the carriers developed MRSA bacteremia during the study period. The total cost of our screening approach, that is, screening and isolation costs, was US  93,930. The total cost of an alternative strategy (ie, no mass screening administered) would be equivalent to costs of isolation of index cases and contact tracing was estimated to be US  5,382 (difference, US  88,548). CONCLUSIONS In an area of low MRSA endemicity (<5%), regular nasal screenings of a high-risk population yielded a low rate of MRSA carriers. Twice-yearly MRSA screening of dialysis patients is unlikely to be cost-effective if MRSA prevalence is low. Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 2015;00(0):1-4.

26029747|t|Carrier concentration dependent optical and electrical properties of Ga doped ZnO hexagonal nanocrystals.
26029747|a|UNASSIGNED: Colloidal trivalent gallium (Ga) doped zinc oxide (ZnO) hexagonal nanocrystals have been prepared to introduce more carrier concentration into the wide band gap of ZnO. The dopant (Ga) modifies the morphology and size of ZnO nanocrystals. Low content of Ga enhances the optical band gap of ZnO due to excess carrier concentration in the conduction band of ZnO. The interaction among free carriers arising from higher concentration of Ga gives rise to narrowing of the band gap. Surface plasmon resonance absorption appears in the infrared region due to excessive carrier concentration. A broad emission band consists of blue, yellow and green colors associated with different native defects of ZnO. Intrinsic defects and extrinsic dopant Ga control the defect related emission spectrum in the visible region. Replacement of Zn by Ga induces a room temperature metallic state in a degenerate semiconductor. Cationic disorder leads to metal-semiconductor transition at low temperature strongly dependent on the concentration of Ga. Pure semiconducting behavior up to about 80 K is observed for the highest amount of Ga. Temperature dependent metal-semiconductor transition has been interpreted by localization of charge carriers due to disorder arising from random Ga substitution.

26113543|t|Appeals against detention in excessive security (outcomes of appeals against detention in conditions of excessive security in Scotland).
26113543|a|UNASSIGNED: The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 introduced the right for patients in high-security psychiatric care to appeal against detention in conditions of excessive security. A previous study examined the first 100 patients to appeal under this provision. In this study we compare them with the next cohort of 110 patients to lodge an appeal, finding, contrary to expectations, no change in patient characteristics or the outcome of their appeals. The clinical, legal and demographic features of successful and unsuccessful appellants, who made up 38% and 27% of the 110 patients, respectively, were also compared. Those patients with the support of their responsible medical officer and those already included on a transfer list had a significantly better chance of success (p   =   0.00). It was also found that a history of excessive alcohol consumption was associated with successful appeals (p   =   0.002). A diagnosis of learning disability was associated with unsuccessful appeals (p   =   0.018), though the sub-sample was very small. These findings are important given the forthcoming extension of this right of appeal to other levels of security.

26061588|t|Irregular 24-hour activity rhythms and the metabolic syndrome in older adults.
26061588|a|UNASSIGNED: Circadian rhythms - near 24   h intrinsic biological rhythms - modulate many aspects of human physiology and hence disruption of circadian rhythms may have an important impact on human health. Experimental work supports a potential link between irregular circadian rhythms and several key risk factors for cardiovascular disease including hypertension, obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia, collectively termed the metabolic syndrome. While several epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between shift-work and the components of the metabolic syndrome in working-age adults, there is a relative paucity of data concerning the impact of non-occupational circadian irregularity in older women and men. To address this question, we studied 7 days of actigraphic data from 1137 older woman and men participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a community-based cohort study of the chronic conditions of aging. The regularity of activity rhythms was quantified using the nonparametric interdaily stability metric, and was related to the metabolic syndrome and its components obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia. More regular activity rhythms were associated with a lower odds of having the metabolic syndrome (OR   =   0.69, 95% CI   =   0.60-0.80, p   =   5.8   *   10(-7)), being obese (OR   =   0.73, 95% CI   =   0.63-0.85, p   =   2.5   *   10(-5)), diabetic (OR   =   0.76, 95% CI   =   0.65-0.90, p   =   9.3   *   10(-4)), hypertensive (OR   =   0.78, 95% CI   =   0.66-0.91, p   =   2.0   *   10(-3)) or dyslipidemic (OR   =   0.82, 95% CI   =   0.72-0.92, p   =   1.2   *   10(-3)). These associations were independent of differences in objectively measured total daily physical activity or rest, and were not accounted for by prevalent coronary artery disease, stroke or peripheral artery disease. Moreover, more regular activity rhythms were associated with lower odds of having cardiovascular disease (OR   =   0.83; 95% CI   =   0.73-0.95, p   =   5.7   *   10(-3)), an effect that was statistically mediated by the metabolic syndrome. We conclude that irregular activity rhythms are associated with several key components of the metabolic syndrome in older community-dwelling adults, and that the metabolic syndrome statistically partially mediates the association between activity rhythms and prevalent cardiovascular disease. Although additional longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to conclusively delineate the causal relationships underlying these associations, these findings are consistent with preclinical data, and add further support for investigations of the irregularity of activity rhythms as a potential therapeutic target to decrease the burden of cardiovascular disease in older adults.

26056887|a|UNASSIGNED: Reports of neoplasia in Chiroptera species are rare. (6 , 10) This retrospective study describes five types of neoplasia identified within a captive population of male Egyptian fruit bats ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ) housed in a zoo from 2004 through November of 2014. Tumor types identified include fibrosarcoma, cutaneous lymphoma, benign focal bronchioloalveolar neoplasm, anaplastic sarcoma, and sebaceous epithelioma. To the author's knowledge, aside from a recent report of focal brochioloalveolar adenoma, (8) these tumor types have not previously been described in the Rousettus species, nor in chiropterans in general. Based upon these findings and other recent publications regarding R. aegyptiacus , neoplasia does appear to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in captive members of this megachiropterid species.

26056876|t|DISPOSITION OF CEFTIOFUR AND ITS ACTIVE METABOLITES IN FALLOW DEER (DAMA DAMA) FOLLOWING SINGLE-DOSE INTRAVENOUS AND INTRAMUSCULAR ADMINISTRATION.
26056876|a|UNASSIGNED: Septicemia and foot infections associated with Fusobacterium necrophorum , Pasturella multocida, and Streptococcus suis in captive fallow deer ( Dama dama ) are reasonably treated with ceftiofur hydrochloride. This study describes the disposition of ceftiofur after single-dose intravenous and intramuscular administration of 3.65    0.1678 mg/kg in six female adult fallow deer using a nonrandomized crossover design and a 7-day washout period. Serial blood samples were collected for 12 hr postdrug administration. Ceftiofur bioactivity, including its active metabolite desfuroylceftiofur, was quantitated in serum using a microbiologic assay. After i.v. administration, the extrapolated serum drug concentration reported as median (range) was 52.83 (43.32-57.49)  g/ml and elimination half-life was 178.36 (19.75-217.22) min. The volume of distribution at steady-state was 0.171 (0.101-0.229) L/kg and serum clearance was 0.97 (0.48-4.3) ml/min per kg. After i.m. administration, median peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 14.37 (9.00-32.00)  g/ml at 54.5 (11.00-95.00) min. The median elimination half-life and mean residence time were 128.32 (38.03-242.40) and 203.65 (62.48-347.15) min, respectively. The median absorption time after i.m. administration was 14.77 (-57.74 to 94.79) min. Bioavailability of ceftiofur following i.m. administration was 78.00 (58.00-137.00) percent. Based on this study, a mean i.m. dose of ceftiofur of 3.65    0.1678 mg/kg every 12 hr is recommended for maintaining serum concentrations above MIC90 levels for infections associated with F. necrophorum , P. multocida , and S. suis , in addition to other susceptible infectious bacteria.

26054534|t|The in vitro and in vivo Evaluation of Fenofibrate with a Self- Microemulsifying Formulation.
26054534|a|Fenofibrate is virtually insoluble in water and is highly lipophilic, which leads to poor oral bioavailability. The purpose of this approach is to develop self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) for oral bioavailability enhancement of fenofibrate. The in vitro dissolution test and pharmacokinetic behavior in beagle dogs were conducted to assess the formulation of fenofibrate in selfmicroemulsifying systems. The concentrations of fenofibrate were determined by HPLC. A crossover fashion study was performed in six fasted beagle dogs with SMEDDS formulation and commercial capsules. The results showed that SMEDDS formulation provides a good drug release with more than 90% of fenofibrate dissoluted from self-emulsifying formulations while less than 10% from the commercial capsules was released within 20min. The mean particle size of SMEDDS formulation after dispersion was about 33.7nm In pharmacokinetic parameters of SMEDDS formulation, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was significantly higher and was approximately 7-fold greater than that obtained when commercial capsule of the same dose of fenofibrate was administered. Also, the maximum absorption was advanced (2h to 1.25h) with SMEDDS formulation. The self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems can significantly increase fenofibrate dissolution in vitro and absorption in vivo.

26058011|t|Antibiofilm Activity of the Brown Alga Halidrys siliquosa against Clinically Relevant Human Pathogens.
26058011|a|UNASSIGNED: The marine brown alga Halidrys siliquosa is known to produce compounds with antifouling activity against several marine bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of organic extracts obtained from the marine brown alga H. siliquosa against a focused panel of clinically relevant human pathogens commonly associated with biofilm-related infections. The partially fractionated methanolic extract obtained from H. siliquosa collected along the shores of Co. Donegal; Ireland; displayed antimicrobial activity against bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus; Streptococcus; Enterococcus; Pseudomonas; Stenotrophomonas; and Chromobacterium with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.0391 to 5 mg/mL. Biofilms of S. aureus MRSA were found to be susceptible to the algal methanolic extract with MBEC values ranging from 1.25 mg/mL to 5 mg/mL respectively. Confocal laser scanning microscopy using LIVE/DEAD staining confirmed the antimicrobial nature of the antibiofilm activity observed using the MBEC assay. A bioassay-guided fractionation method was developed yielding 10 active fractions from which to perform purification and structural elucidation of clinically-relevant antibiofilm compounds.

26056817|t|Amino Acid Flux from Metabolic Network Benefits Protein Translation: the Role of Resource Availability.
26056817|a|UNASSIGNED: Protein translation is a central step in gene expression and affected by many factors such as codon usage bias, mRNA folding energy and tRNA abundance. Despite intensive previous studies, how metabolic amino acid supply correlates with protein translation efficiency remains unknown. In this work, we estimated the amino acid flux from metabolic network for each protein in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using Flux Balance Analysis. Integrated with the mRNA expression level, protein abundance and ribosome profiling data, we provided a detailed description of the role of amino acid supply in protein translation. Our results showed that amino acid supply positively correlates with translation efficiency and ribosome density. Moreover, with the rank-based regression model, we found that metabolic amino acid supply facilitates ribosome utilization. Based on the fact that the ribosome density change of well-amino-acid-supplied genes is smaller than poorly-amino-acid-supply genes under amino acid starvation, we reached the conclusion that amino acid supply may buffer ribosome density change against amino acid starvation and benefit maintaining a relatively stable translation environment. Our work provided new insights into the connection between metabolic amino acid supply and protein translation process by revealing a new regulation strategy that is dependent on resource availability.

26058164|t|Plant cell, tissue and organ culture: the most flexible foundations for plant metabolic engineering applications.
26058164|a|Significant advances in plant cell, tissue and organ culture (PCTOC) have been made in the last five decades. PCTOC is now thought to be the underlying technique for understanding general or specific biological functions of the plant kingdom, and it is one of the most flexible foundations for morphological, physiological and molecular biological applications of plants. Furthermore, the recent advances in the field of information technology (IT) have enabled access to a large amount of information regarding all aspects of plant biology. For example, sequencing information is stored in mega repositories such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), which can be easily accessed by researchers worldwide. To date, the PCTOC and IT combination strategy for regulation of target plant metabolism and the utilization of bioactive plant metabolites for commercial purposes is essential. In this review, the advantages and the limitations of these methodologies, especially regarding the production of bioactive plant secondary metabolites and metabolic engineering in target plants are discussed mainly from the phenotypic view point.

26059986|t|Exploring the Paradox of Intimate Partner Violence and Increased Contraceptive Use in sub-Saharan Africa.
26059986|a|We question the positive effect of intimate partner violence on women's modern contraceptive use in sub-Saharan Africa found in previous studies. The explanations offered for this counter-intuitive result are either that women make greater efforts to avoid childbearing in conflictual relationships, or that endogeneity bias exists. Endogeneity bias stems from the inability of researchers to attribute a specific cause to one variable when they are unable to control for related missing covariates. Demographic and Health Survey data from 13 countries in sub-Saharan Africa provide evidence for the latter but not the former. Indeed, using simple probit regression models, we observe a positive relationship between intimate partner violence and modern contraceptive use in Burkina Faso, Mali, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. This effect remains unchanged when controlling for various measures of women's autonomy in the household, showing that these two variables interact with contraceptive use independently. However, the use of recursive bivariate probit and Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis to control for endogeneity biases erodes the initial positive effect in the five countries, although only partially in Burkina Faso. Our research shows that the previously reported findings arise from poor model specification and highlights the need for more appropriate data to assess the effect of intimate partner violence on modern contraceptive use in sub-Saharan Africa.

26060275|t|csrR, a Paralog and Direct Target of CsrA, Promotes Legionella pneumophila Resilience in Water.
26060275|a|Critical to microbial versatility is the capacity to express the cohort of genes that increase fitness in different environments. Legionella pneumophila occupies extensive ecological space that includes diverse protists, pond water, engineered water systems, and mammalian lung macrophages. One mechanism that equips this opportunistic pathogen to adapt to fluctuating conditions is a switch between replicative and transmissive cell types that is controlled by the broadly conserved regulatory protein CsrA. A striking feature of the legionellae surveyed is that each of 14 strains encodes 4 to 7 csrA-like genes, candidate regulators of distinct fitness traits. Here we focus on the one csrA paralog (lpg1593) that, like the canonical csrA, is conserved in all 14 strains surveyed. Phenotypic analysis revealed that long-term survival in tap water is promoted by the lpg1593 locus, which we name csrR (for "CsrA-similar protein for resilience"). As predicted by its GGA motif, csrR mRNA was bound directly by the canonical CsrA protein, as judged by electromobility shift and RNA-footprinting assays. Furthermore, CsrA repressed translation of csrR mRNA in vivo, as determined by analysis of csrR-gfp reporters, csrR mRNA stability in the presence and absence of csrA expression, and mutation of the CsrA binding site identified on the csrR mRNA. Thus, CsrA not only governs the transition from replication to transmission but also represses translation of its paralog csrR when nutrients are available. We propose that, during prolonged starvation, relief of CsrA repression permits CsrR protein to coordinate L.  pneumophila's switch to a cell type that is resilient in water supplies. IMPORTANCE: Persistence of L.  pneumophila in water systems is a public health risk, and yet there is little understanding of the genetic determinants that equip this opportunistic pathogen to adapt to and survive in natural or engineered water systems. A potent regulator of this pathogen's intracellular life cycle is CsrA, a protein widely distributed among bacterial species that is understood quite well. Our finding that every sequenced L.  pneumophila strain carries several csrA paralogs-including two common to all isolates-indicates that the legionellae exploit CsrA regulatory switches for multiple purposes. Our discovery that one paralog, CsrR, is a target of CsrA that enhances survival in water is an important step toward understanding colonization of the engineered environment by pathogenic L.  pneumophila.

26025205|t|The critical role of Akt in cardiovascular function.
26025205|a|UNASSIGNED: Akt kinase, a member of AGC kinases, is important in many cellular functions including proliferation, migration, cell growth and metabolism. There are three known Akt isoforms which play critical and diverse roles in the cardiovascular system. Akt activity is regulated by its upstream regulatory pathways at transcriptional and post-translational levels. Beta-catenin/Tcf-4, GLI1 and Stat-3 are some of few known transcriptional regulators of AKT gene. Threonine 308 and serine 473 are the two critical phosphorylation sites of Akt1. Translocation of Akt to the cell membrane facilitates PDK1 phosphorylation of the threonine site. The serine site is phosphorylated by mTORC2. Ack1, Src, PTK6, TBK1, IKBKE and IKK   are some of the non-canonical pathways which affect the Akt activity. Protein-protein interactions of Akt to actin and Hsp90 increase the Akt activity while Akt binding to other proteins such as CTMP and TRB3 reduces the Akt activity. The action of Akt on its downstream targets determines its function in cardiovascular processes such as cell survival, growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, vasorelaxation, and cell metabolism. Akt promotes cell survival via caspase-9, YAP, Bcl-2, and Bcl-x activities. Inhibition of FoxO proteins by Akt also increases cell survival by transcriptional mechanisms. Akt stimulates cell growth and proliferation through mTORC1. Akt also increases VEGF secretion and mediates eNOS phosphorylation, vasorelaxation and angiogenesis. Akt can increase cellular metabolism through its downstream targets GSK3 and GLUT4. The alterations of Akt signaling play an important role in many cardiovascular pathological processes such as atherosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy, and vascular remodeling. Several Akt inhibitors have been developed and tested as anti-tumor agents. They could be potential novel therapeutics for the cardiovascular diseases.

26060586|t|Paget Disease of the Vulva: Diagnosis by Immunohistochemistry.
26060586|a|The objective of this paper is to report a case of extramammary Paget disease of the vulva, to describe its diagnosis, surgical treatment, and outcome, and to discuss the general characteristics of this pathology. This is a rare neoplasm, found principally in areas in which apocrine and eccrine glands are numerous. This case report is relevant to the literature since the differential diagnosis of extramammary Paget disease is difficult to be done only with the macroscopic appearance of the lesion and even with the microscopic characteristics, requiring further studies, immunohistochemistry, as to differentiate pathologies. The present report describes the case of a 63-year-old patient at the Santa Casa de Miseric  rdia Hospital in Vit  ria, Esp  rito Santo, Brazil, who presented with a hardened, ulcerated, and purplish lesion with hyperchromic and hypochromic spots, measuring 4   cm in diameter, located on the lower third of right labium majus, close to the vaginal fourchette. A right hemivulvectomy was performed, leaving wide margins all around. The patient progressed satisfactorily following surgery. Although extramammary Paget disease is rare, its incidence increases as a function of the patient's age. Patients should be followed up closely because of the risk of persistence and/or recurrence of the disease.

26058320|t|Psychoanalysis of maturescence (definition, metapsychology, and clinical practice).
26058320|a|UNASSIGNED: This article offers an entirely new way of addressing middle age or mid-life. It uses the neologism maturescence to denote this process's metapsychological feature, and it proposes a meta-psychology of maturescence in order to allow a 'direct understanding of maturescence' instead of the 'indirect understanding of maturescence', which psychoanalytic literature generally alludes to. The paper examines somatic processes specific to male and female climacterics and is focused on to the tension between the soma and the body. It examines the drive increase that Freud posed in climacterics and the somatic climacteric imbalance that begets specific drive activity demanding psychic work, with very different pathways depending on the individual's specific working-through activity. It discusses what happens to the individual when he/she is no longer able to procreate and begins to age; why this process is equivalent for individuals who had children and for others who could not or did not. This somatic event provides a universal constant from which it is possible to understand any individual variable.

26060356|t|Cognitive Impairment and Brain Imaging Characteristics of Patients with Congenital Cataracts, Facial Dysmorphism, Neuropathy Syndrome.
26060356|a|Congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism, neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome is a complex autosomal recessive multisystem disorder. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the degree of cognitive impairment in a cohort of 22 CCFDN patients and its correlation with patients' age, motor disability, ataxia, and neuroimaging changes. Twenty-two patients with genetically confirmed diagnosis of CCFDN underwent a detailed neurological examination. Verbal and nonverbal intelligence, memory, executive functions, and verbal fluency w  re assessed in all the patients aged 4 to 47 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 20 affected patients. Eighteen affected were classified as having mild intellectual deficit, whereas 4 had borderline intelligence. In all psychometric tests, evaluating different cognitive domains, CCFDN patients had statistically significant lower scores when compared to the healthy control group. All cognitive domains seemed equally affected. The main abnormalities on brain MRI found in 19/20 patients included diffuse cerebral atrophy, enlargement of the lateral ventricles, and focal lesions in the subcortical white matter, different in number and size, consistent with demyelination more pronounced in the older CCFDN patients. The correlation analysis of the structural brain changes and the cognitive impairment found a statistically significant correlation only between the impairment of short-term verbal memory and the MRI changes.

26023685|t|HIV Tat 101-mediated loss of pericytes at the blood-brain barrier involves PDGF-BB.
26023685|a|UNASSIGNED: HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) affect almost 30-50% of infected individuals, even in the presence of successful control of virus replication by combined antiretroviral therapy (cART).HIV Tat protein, a nuclear trans-activator of viral gene transcription, that is secreted by infected cells and can be taken up by the neighboring cells, is present in various tissues despite the presence of cART, and has been shown to break down the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This, in turn, leads to disruption of the neovascular unit, affecting functioning of the brain microvascular endothelial cells as well as astrocytes. Pericytes, yet another important constituent of the BBB, play a critical role in the maintenance of the integrity of the BBB. Loss of pericytes resulting in disruption of BBB has been observed in several pathologies including HAND. Furthermore, while PDGF-BB is essential for pericyte generation, paradoxically, high concentrations of PDGF-BB lead to loss of pericytes in tumor vessels. In this research highlight, we provide a brief review of our recently published finding, which have demonstrated a novel role of PDGF-BB in HIV-Tat mediated migration of pericytes, leading ultimately to loss of pericyte coverage from the endothelium, with a subsequent breach of the BBB. These findings underpin yet another mechanism by which BBB integrity is disrupted in HAND.

26020825|t|Novel Mutation in the CHRDL1 Gene Detected in Patients With Megalocornea.
26020825|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the mutation associated with X-linked megalocornea (MGC1) found in 2 patients from the same area in southern Italy. METHODS: Diagnosis of megalocornea was confirmed by detailed ophthalmic examination in 2 probands from independent families and in another 3 affected family members. Genomic DNA of the probands was used to amplify and sequence all the coding regions of CHRDL1. RESULTS: Megalocornea diagnosis was associated with a novel mutation found in the probands and affected kindreds (5 subjects). The mutation is an 11-base pair deletion that leads to a stop codon in the second coding exon of the CHRDL1 gene. Research on the CHRDL1 mutation was also performed on other family members (11 subjects) not affected by MGC1, and the mutation was not detected in unaffected male family members. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of mutations in the CHRDL1 gene is useful for differential diagnosis with different forms of megalocornea.

26018312|t|Effect of prosthodontic planning on lateral occlusion scheme: a comparison between conventional and digital planning.
26018312|a|Recently, digital wax-up is proposed as a tool to aid prosthodontic planning. However, there are no data about the effect of prosthodontic planning on lateral occlusion scheme. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the impact of conventional and digital prosthodontic planning on lateral occlusion scheme. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dental models of 10 patients were collected. All models had Angle Class I occlusion and were undergoing prosthodontic treatment that would influence the lateral occlusion scheme. Each set of models had received both conventional wax-up and digital wax-up. In relation to the lateral occlusion scheme, the following variables were evaluated: the prevalence of the different lateral occlusion scheme, number of contacting teeth and percentage of each contacting tooth. Four excursive positions on the working side were included: 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mm from the maximal intercuspation position. RESULTS: The lateral occlusion scheme of the two wax-up models was subjected to alterations following excursion. There was a tendency for the prevalence of canine-guided occlusion to increase and for the prevalence of group function occlusion to decrease with increasing excursion. The number of contacting teeth was decreasing with the increasing magnitude of excursion. For the 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm positions, the two wax-ups had significantly greater contacts than the pre-treatment models, while at the 2.0 mm and 3.0 mm positions, all the models were similar. For all models, canines were the most commonly contacting teeth, followed by the teeth adjacent to them. No difference was observed between the two wax-ups in relation to the number of contacting teeth. CONCLUSION: Although the prosthodontic planning had influenced the pattern of the lateral occlusion scheme and contacts, there was no difference between the conventional and digital prosthodontic planning.

26020209|t|Impact of supplemental protein source offered to primiparous heifers during gestation on II. Progeny performance and carcass characteristics.
26020209|a|UNASSIGNED: A 3-yr study using primiparous crossbred beef heifers ( = 114) was conducted to determine the effects of protein supplement during late gestation on progeny performance and carcass characteristics. Pregnant heifers were stratified by heifer development system, initial BW, and AI service sire and placed in an individual feeding system. Heifers were offered meadow hay (8 to 11% CP) from early November to mid-February and provided no supplement (CON; = 37), 0.83 kg/d (DM basis) of a dried distillers grains with solubles-based supplement (HI; = 39), or 0.83 kg/d (DM basis) of a dried corn gluten feed-based supplement (LO; = 38). Supplements were designed to be isonitrogenous (28% CP) and isocaloric but to differ in RUP with HI (59% RUP) having greater levels of RUP than LO (34% RUP). After the individual feeding period, heifers were placed in a drylot for calving. All heifers were bred using a fixed-timed AI protocol and pairs were moved to a commercial ranch in the Nebraska Sandhills for summer grazing. Calf weaning BW did not differ ( = 0.14) based on maternal diet. However, feedlot entry BW was greater ( = 0.03) for HI compared with CON calves. Average daily gain during the initial feedlot phase tended ( = 0.10) to be greatest for calves born to CON dams and lowest for calves born to LO dams. However, overall ADG was similar ( = 0.50) for the entire feedlot period. Residual feed intake during the reimplant and total feeding period was improved in calves born to supplemented dams in yr 2 and 3 compared with calves born to CON dams. There was no difference in final BW among treatments ( = 0.71). Hot carcass weight was similar ( = 0.72) among treatments; however, steers had greater ( < 0.01) HCW than heifers. Furthermore, percent empty body fat and 12th rib fat thickness were lowest ( = 0.05 and = 0.04) for calves born to LO dams. Tenderness measured by Warner-Bratzler shear force was increased ( = 0.03) in longissimus samples from calves from CON dams compared to calves from LO dams. Similarly, crude fat levels tended to be greater ( = 0.07) for calves from CON dams compared with calves from LO dams. Based on these data, providing RUP supplements, similar to those used in this study, to primiparous heifers in late gestation consuming ad libitum grass hay resulted in increased initial feedlot BW for HI compared to CON calves, improved feed efficiency, and altered carcass characteristics in calves born to supplemented compared with CON dams.

26017718|t|Diagnosis of toxoplasmosis and typing of Toxoplasma gondii.
26017718|a|UNASSIGNED: Toxoplasmosis, caused by the obligate intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, is an important zoonosis with medical and veterinary importance worldwide. The disease is mainly contracted by ingesting undercooked or raw meat containing viable tissue cysts, or by ingesting food or water contaminated with oocysts. The diagnosis and genetic characterization of T. gondii infection is crucial for the surveillance, prevention and control of toxoplasmosis. Traditional approaches for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis include etiological, immunological and imaging techniques. Diagnosis of toxoplasmosis has been improved by the emergence of molecular technologies to amplify parasite nucleic acids. Among these, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular techniques have been useful for the genetic characterization of T. gondii. Serotyping methods based on polymorphic polypeptides have the potential to become the choice for typing T. gondii in humans and animals. In this review, we summarize conventional non-DNA-based diagnostic methods, and the DNA-based molecular techniques for the diagnosis and genetic characterization of T. gondii. These techniques have provided foundations for further development of more effective and accurate detection of T. gondii infection. These advances will contribute to an improved understanding of the epidemiology, prevention and control of toxoplasmosis.

26033320|t|Clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of gastric cancer showing gastric and intestinal mucin phenotype.
26033320|a|UNASSIGNED: Gastric cancer (GC), one of the most common human cancers, can be classified into gastric or intestinal phenotype according to mucin expression. TP53 mutation, allelic deletion of the APC gene, and nuclear staining of b-catenin are frequently detected in the intestinal phenotype of GC, whereas CDH1 gene mutation, microsatellite instability, and DNA hypermethylation of MLH1 are common events in the gastric phenotype of GC. Our Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) and Escherichia coli ampicillin secretion trap (CAST) analyses revealed that CDH17, REG4, OLFM4, HOXA10, DSC2, TSPAN8, and TM9SF3 are upregulated in GC, and CLDN18 is downregulated in GC. Expression of CDH17, REG4, HOXA10, and DSC2, and downregulation of CLDN18 is observed in the intestinal phenotype of GC. In contrast, OLFM4 is expressed in the gastric phenotype of GC. Expression of TSPAN8, TM9SF3, and HER2 are not associated with either gastric or intestinal phenotypes. Ectopic CDX2 expression plays a key function in the GC intestinal phenotype. MUC2, CDH17, REG4, DSC2, and ABCB1 are direct targets of CDX2. Importantly, these genes encode transmembrane/secretory proteins, indicating that the microenvironment as well as cancer cells are also different between gastric and intestinal phenotypes of GC.

26037127|t|Small and inconsistent effects of whole body vibration on athletic performance: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
26037127|a|PURPOSE: We quantified the acute and chronic effects of whole body vibration on athletic performance or its proxy measures in competitive and/or elite athletes. METHODS: Systematic literature review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: Whole body vibration combined with exercise had an overall 0.3  % acute effect on maximal voluntary leg force (-6.4  %, effect size  =  -0.43, 1 study), leg power (4.7  %, weighted mean effect size  =  0.30, 6 studies), flexibility (4.6  %, effect size  =  -0.12 to 0.22, 2 studies), and athletic performance (-1.9  %, weighted mean effect size  =  0.26, 6 studies) in 191 (103 male, 88 female) athletes representing eight sports (overall effect size  =  0.28). Whole body vibration combined with exercise had an overall 10.2  % chronic effect on maximal voluntary leg force (14.6  %, weighted mean effect size  =  0.44, 5 studies), leg power (10.7  %, weighted mean effect size  =  0.42, 9 studies), flexibility (16.5  %, effect size  =  0.57 to 0.61, 2 studies), and athletic performance (-1.2  %, weighted mean effect size  =  0.45, 5 studies) in 437 (169 male, 268 female) athletes (overall effect size  =  0.44). CONCLUSIONS: Whole body vibration has small and inconsistent acute and chronic effects on athletic performance in competitive and/or elite athletes. These findings lead to the hypothesis that neuromuscular adaptive processes following whole body vibration are not specific enough to enhance athletic performance. Thus, other types of exercise programs (e.g., resistance training) are recommended if the goal is to improve athletic performance.

26038579|t|Fasting-induced lipolysis and hypothalamic insulin signaling are regulated by neuronal glucosylceramide synthase.
26038579|a|UNASSIGNED: Central nervous regulation of body weight and adipose tissue function is mainly conducted by hypothalamic neurons. Neuronal function depends on the integrity of the membrane lipid microenvironment. Lipid microdomains contain large quantities of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, including glucosylceramide synthase (GCS; gene: Ugcg)-derived gangliosides. The present study demonstrates that Ugcgf/f//CamKCreERT2 mice with genetic GCS deletion in forebrain neurons, dominantly targeting mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), display impaired fasting-induced lipolysis accompanied by a decreased norepinephrine content in white adipose tissue (WAT). MBH insulin receptor (IR) levels and signaling are increased in Ugcgf/f//CamKCreERT2 mice. These results are in concordance with reports stating that MBH insulin signaling restrains sympathetic nervous outflow to WAT in fasted mice. In line with the in vivo data, pharmacological GCS inhibition by Genz123346 also increases IR levels as well as IR phosphorylation in insulin-stimulated hypothalamic cells. In addition to studies suggesting that simple gangliosides like GM3 regulate peripheral IR signaling, this work suggests that also complex neuronal gangliosides modulate hypothalamic IR signaling and protein levels. Exemplarily, the complex ganglioside GD1a interacts dynamically with the IR on adult hypothalamic neurons. In summary, our results suggest that neuronal GCS expression modulates MBH insulin signaling and WAT function in fasted mice.

26075383|t|2-O Heparan Sulfate Sulfation by Hs2st Is Required for Erk/Mapk Signalling Activation at the Mid-Gestational Mouse Telencephalic Midline.
26075383|a|UNASSIGNED: Heparan sulfate (HS) is a linear carbohydrate composed of polymerized uronate-glucosamine disaccharide units that decorates cell surface and secreted glycoproteins in the extracellular matrix. In mammals HS is subjected to differential sulfation by fifteen different heparan sulfotransferase (HST) enzymes of which Hs2st uniquely catalyzes the sulfation of the 2-O position of the uronate in HS. HS sulfation is postulated to be important for regulation of signaling pathways by facilitating the interaction of HS with signaling proteins including those of the Fibroblast Growth Factor (Fgf) family which signal through phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases Erk1/2. In the developing mouse telencephalon Fgf2 signaling regulates proliferation and neurogenesis. Loss of Hs2st function phenocopies the thinned cerebral cortex of mutant mice in which Fgf2 or Erk1/2 function are abrogated, suggesting the hypothesis that 2-O-sulfated HS structures play a specific role in Fgf2/Erk signaling pathway in this context in vivo. This study investigated the molecular role of 2-O sulfation in Fgf2/Erk signaling in the developing telencephalic midline midway through mouse embryogenesis at E12.5. We examined the expression of Hs2st, Fgf2, and Erk1/2 activity in wild-type and Hs2st-/- mice. We found that Hs2st is expressed at high levels at the midline correlating with high levels of Erk1/2 activation and Erk1/2 activation was drastically reduced in the Hs2st-/- mutant at the rostral telencephalic midline. We also found that 2-O sulfation is specifically required for the binding of Fgf2 protein to Fgfr1, its major cell-surface receptor at the rostral telencephalic midline. We conclude that 2-O sulfated HS structures generated by Hs2st are needed to form productive signaling complexes between HS, Fgf2 and Fgfr1 that activate Erk1/2 at the midline. Overall, our data suggest the interesting possibility that differential expression of Hs2st targets the rostral telencephalic midline for high levels of Erk signaling by increasing the sensitivity of cells to an Fgf2 signal that is rather more widespread.

26042271|t|Adolescent and young pregnant women at increased risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and poorer maternal and infant health outcomes: A cohort study at public facilities in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan district, Eastern Cape, South Africa.
26042271|a|BACKGROUND: South Africa (SA) has the highest burden of childhood HIV infection globally, and has high rates of adolescent and youth pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: To explore risks associated with pregnancy in young HIV-infected women, we compared mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV and maternal and infant health outcomes according to maternal age categories. METHODS: A cohort of HIV-positive pregnant women and their infants were followed up at three sentinel surveillance facilities in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan (NMBM) district, Eastern Cape Province, SA. Young women were defined as 24 years old and adolescents as 19 years. The effect of younger maternal age categories on MTCT and maternal and child health outcomes was assessed using log-binomial and Cox regression controlling for confounding, using women aged > 24 years as the comparison group. RESULTS: Of 956 mothers, 312 (32.6%) were young women; of these, 65 (20.8%) were adolescents. The proportion of young pregnant women increased by 24% between 2009/10 and 2011/12 (from 28.3% to 35.1%). Young women had an increased risk of being unaware of their HIV status when booking (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 - 1.54), a reduced rate of antenatal antiretroviral therapy (ART) uptake (adjusted hazard ratio 0.46; 95% CI 0.31 - 0.67), reduced early infant HIV diagnosis (aRR 0.94; 95% CI 0.94 - 0.94), and increased MTCT (aRR 3.07; 95% CI 1.18 - 7.96; adjusted for ART use). Of all vertical transmissions, 56% occurred among young women. Additionally, adolescents had increased risks of first presentation during labour (aRR 3.78; 95% CI 1.06 - 13.4); maternal mortality (aRR 35.1; 95% CI 2.89 - 426) and stillbirth (aRR 3.33; 95% CI 1.53 - 7.25). CONCLUSION: An increasing proportion of pregnant HIV-positive women in NMBM were young, and they had increased MTCT and poorer maternal and infant outcomes than older women. Interventions targeting young women are increasingly needed to reduce pregnancy, HIV infection and MTCT and improve maternal and infant outcomes if SA is to attain its Millennium Development Goals.

26031154|t|[Gender-specific features of chronic heart failure].
26031154|a|AIM: To estimate the prevalence of chronic heart failure (CHF) in Azerbajan and analyse its gender-specific features in hospital patients based on retrospective observations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis included 3614 case histories of the patients admitted to D.M.Abdullaev Research Institute of Cardiology. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of CHF was estimated at 51.4%, lethality at 6%. The main causative factors of CHF were coronary heart disease and arterial hypertension. Marked differences in CHF etiology between men and women of different age were revealed. The prevalence of CHF in men was 56.8% or 1.3 times that in women. 41% of the patients with CHF were above 60 years of age. CHF with left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 45% and with the preserved one was found in 84% and 16% of the patients respectively. The number of women with this variant of CHF amounted to 22% and was 2 times that of men.

26033850|t|Disclosure of psychiatric manifestations of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in medical genetics: A 12-year retrospective chart review.
26033850|a|UNASSIGNED: Individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS) have increased risk for psychiatric disorders. However, while medical geneticists self-report discussing psychiatric features of 22qDS with families (though often only when the child is older), most parents of children with 22qDS report receiving information about the psychiatric manifestations of 22qDS from non-medical sources. In an attempt to reconcile these previous findings, we sought to objectively determine the frequency with which medical geneticists discuss the potential psychiatric manifestations of 22qDS: (i) in letters to referring physicians and (ii) with families, and to explore plans for follow-up. We abstracted data from charts of patients with 22qDS who were referred to a single medical genetics center between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2012. Psychiatric disorders were discussed in consult letters to referring physicians for n   =   57 (46%) of the 125 patients who met inclusion criteria-making them less frequently discussed than all other features of 22qDS. Despite exhaustive review of charts, the content of discussions with families was typically unclear. Follow-up in medical genetics was suggested for 50 people but only 18 (36%) of these patients returned. Disclosure of psychiatric features of 22qDS to families is necessary so that psychiatric disorders can be identified in time for early intervention to be implemented to achieve better prognosis for those affected. These empiric data offer some explanation as to why psychiatric services are underused by individuals with 22qDS.    2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

26038357|t|Perinatal risk factors for premature ischaemic heart disease in a Swedish national cohort.
26038357|a|OBJECTIVE: Several studies have reported associations between restricted fetal development, as shown by birth weight or birth length, and later ischaemic heart disease (IHD). However, few studies have examined the importance of these perinatal factors when taking into account gestational age at birth, hereditary factors, sociodemographic factors and comorbidities. This study investigated the importance of perinatal risk factors for premature IHD and myocardial infarction (MI) in a large Swedish cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: National cohort study of 1   970   869 individuals who were live-born in Sweden in 1973 through 1992, and followed up to 2010 (ages 18-38   years). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome was IHD, and the secondary outcome was MI. RESULTS: A total of 668 individuals were diagnosed with IHD in 18.8 million person-years of follow-up. After adjusting for gestational age at birth, sociodemographic factors, comorbidities and family history of IHD, low fetal growth was associated with increased risk of IHD (HR for <-2 vs -1 to <1 SD, 1.54; 95% CI 1.15 to 2.07; p=0.004) and increased risk of MI (HR for <-2 vs -1 to <1 SD, 2.48; 95% CI 1.66 to 3.71; p<0.001) in young adulthood. In contrast, gestational age at birth was not associated with the risk of IHD or MI. CONCLUSIONS: In this large national cohort, low fetal growth was strongly associated with IHD and MI in young adulthood, independently of gestational age at birth, sociodemographic factors, comorbidities and family history of IHD.

26037059|t|High-grade epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma of the parotid gland with mucous cell differentiation.
26037059|a|UNASSIGNED: Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (EMC) is a rare salivary gland tumor with a low-grade malignancy, and EMC with high-grade histopathological features is exceedingly rare. Furthermore, EMC with intracellular mucin is also extremely rare. We report an uncommon case of a high-grade EMC of the parotid gland with mucous cell differentiation in a 66-year old Japanese woman who noticed a right palpable parotid mass increasing in size within a one-year period. The cytological specimen showed a focally biphasic structure and included isolated or discohesive piled-up clusters with hyaline globules surrounded by neoplastic cells with nuclear atypia. The gross examination revealed a relatively well-demarcated, multinodular gray-whitish and solid mass. Histologically, the tumor consisted of variably sized solid nests or trabeculae with central necrosis and increased mitotic activity, and invaded into adjacent skeletal muscles. Immunohistochemically, the biphasic ductal and myoepithelial differentiation of this tumor confirmed the diagnosis of high-grade EMC. Furthermore, numerous small nests with d-PAS and alcian blue-positive mucous cells predominated in about 5% of the whole tumor, and these mucous cells were encompassed by neoplastic myoepithelial cells. We should recognize this variant of EMC because we can't rule out the possibility of EMC even in the presence of mucous cells.

26016839|t|Neuroprotective effects of quercetin in a mouse model of brain ischemic/reperfusion injury via anti  -apoptotic mechanisms based on the Akt pathway.
26016839|a|UNASSIGNED: The present study provided experimental evidence for the neuroprotective effects of quercetin using a rat model of global brain ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Pre  -treatment with quercetin (5 or 10  mg/kg orally (p.o.); once daily) induced a dose  -dependent reduction in I/R  -induced hippocampal neuron cell loss, with 10  mg/kg/day being the lowest dose that achieved maximal neuroprotection. Administration of 10  mg/kg quercetin over at least 3  days prior to I/R was required to improve the survival rate of I/R rats. Fluorescence  -assisted cell sorting, hematoxylin and eosin staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling indicated neuronal cell loss in the CA1 hippocampus. Rats that had undergone transient global cerebral ischemia for 15  min followed by 1  h of reperfusion exhibited a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the hippocampus. The I/R  -induced ROS overproduction in the hippocampus at 1, 12 and 24  h following I/R was significantly decreased by quercetin pre  -treatment. Western blot analysis revealed that the neuroprotective effects of quercetin (5 and 10  mg/kg/day, p.o.) were associated with an upregulation of the I/R  -induced suppression of B  -cell lymphoma  -2 (Bcl  -2), Bcl extra large and survivin expression as well as phosphorylation of Bcl  -2  -associated death promoter. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of quercetin (5, 10  mg/kg/day) in the brain were associated with an upregulation of Akt signaling. These findings suggested that the inhibition of I/R  -induced brain injury by quercetin likely involves a transcriptional mechanism to enhance anti  -apoptotic signaling.

26018496|t|Streptozotocin Aggravated Osteopathology and Insulin Induced Osteogenesis Through Co-treatment with Fluoride.
26018496|a|UNASSIGNED: The role of insulin in the mechanism underlying the excessive fluoride that causes skeletal lesion was studied. The in vitro bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) collected from Kunming mice were exposed to varying concentrations of fluoride with or without insulin. The cell viability and early differentiation of BMSC co-treated with fluoride and insulin were measured by using cell counting kit-8 and Gomori modified calcium-cobalt method, respectively. We further investigated the in vivo effects of varying dose of fluoride on rats co-treated with streptozotocin (STZ). Wistar rats were divided into six groups which included normal control, 10  mg  fluoride/kg  day group, 20  mg  fluoride/kg  day group, STZ control, STZ + 10  mg  fluoride/kg  day group, and STZ + 20  mg  fluoride/kg  day group. The rats were administered with sodium fluoride (NaF) by gavage with water at doses 10 and 20  mg  fluoride/kg  day for 2  months. In a period of one month, half of rats in every group were treated with streptozotocin (STZ) once through intraperitoneal injection at 52  mg/kg body weight. The serum glucose, HbA1c, and insulin were determined. Bone mineral content and insulin release were assessed. The results showed insulin combined with fluoride stimulated BMSC cell viability in vitro. The bone mineral content reduced in rats treated with higher dose of fluoride and decreased immensely in rat co-treated with fluoride and STZ. Similarly, a combination treatment of a high dose of fluoride and STZ decreased insulin sensitivity and activity. To sum up, these data indicated fluoride influenced insulin release, activity, and sensitivity. Furthermore, the insulin state in vivo interfered in the osteogenesis in turn and implied there was a close relation between insulin and bone pathogenesis in the mechanism of fluoride toxicity.

26020033|t|Phase I trial of sorafenib following liver transplantation in patients with high-risk hepatocellular carcinoma.
26020033|a|Liver transplantation offers excellent long-term survival for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who fall within established criteria. For those outside such criteria, or with high-risk pathologic features in the explant, HCC recurrence rates are higher. We conducted a multicenter phase I trial of sorafenib in liver transplantation patients with high-risk HCC. Subjects had HCC outside the Milan criteria (pre- or post-transplant), poorly differentiated tumors, or vascular invasion. We used a standard 3+3 phase I design with a planned duration of treatment of 24 weeks. Correlative studies included the number of circulating endothelial cells (CECs), plasma biomarkers, and tumor expression of p-Erk, p-Akt, and c-Met in tissue micro-arrays. We enrolled 14 patients with a median age of 63 years. Of these, 93% were men and 71% had underlying hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 21% had HBV. The maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib was 200 mg BID. Grade 3-4 toxicities seen in >10% of subjects included leukopenia (21%), elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (21%), hypertension (14%), hand-foot syndrome (14%) and diarrhea (14%). Over a median follow-up of 953 days, one patient died and four recurred. The mean CEC number at baseline was 21 cells/4 ml for those who recurred, and 80 cells/4 ml for those who did not (p=0.10). Mean soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 levels decreased after 1 month on sorafenib (p=0.09), but did not correlate with recurrence. There was a trend for tumor c-Met expression to correlate with increased risk of recurrence. Post-transplant sorafenib was found to be feasible and tolerable at 200 mg PO BID. The effect of post-transplant sorafenib on recurrence-free survival is potentially promising but needs further validation in a larger study.

26016172|t|Self-efficacy, stress, and social support in retention of student registered nurse anesthetists.
26016172|a|Many studies document the presence of stress and the need for social support in anesthesia students. By addressing these, one can increase students' self-efficacy, which is related to beliefs in one's ability to accomplish an objective. By measuring and instituting measures to increase self-efficacy, we could improve student selection in nurse anesthesia programs, and increase academic success and likelihood of retention. This article reviews the literature on this topic and makes recommendations for increasing student self-efficacy.

26020255|t|Can Empathy Be Taught? Reflections from a Medical Student Active-Listening Workshop.
26020255|a|UNASSIGNED: Medical students deserve training in active listening and counseling before they encounter patients in distress. At the Alpert Medical School of Brown University we created and evaluated a workshop that trains first-year medical students to assess patients' emotional states and express empathy in an efficient and effective manner. Using second-year students as near-peer facilitators, we integrated the workshop into the existing preclinical first-year curriculum. We found that students' self-reported comfort in counseling a patient experiencing an emotionally challenging situation increased from 27% to 79% after the 90-minute workshop.

26065752|t|Characterisation of onion (Allium cepa L.) by-products as food ingredients with antioxidant and antibrowning properties.
26065752|a|Processing and stabilising onion wastes (residues and surpluses of onion) could solve the environmental problem derived from a great onion wastes disposal. Moreover, obtaining stabilised onion by-products as natural antioxidant food ingredients could be advantageous to food industry, not only to improve the use of onion wastes but also to obtain new natural and functional ingredients. The aim of this study was to characterise onion by-products - juice, paste and bagasse - from two Spanish onion cultivars - 'Figueres' and 'Recas' - that have been stabilised by thermal treatments - freezing, pasteurisation and sterilisation - in order to evaluate the effect of the processing and stabilisation treatment on the bioactive composition, antioxidant activity and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzyme inhibition capacity. The results obtained triggered to choose one onion by-product offering better characteristics for its potential development as a food ingredient: source of antioxidant and antibrowning bioactive compounds. In this study it was shown that processing of 'Recas' onion wastes to obtain a paste (mixture content) and applying a mild pasteurisation were the best alternatives to obtain an interesting stabilised onion by-product with good antioxidant properties that made useful its use as functional food ingredient.

26038680|t|The evaluation of swallowing in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia and oropharyngeal dysphagia: A comparison study of videofluoroscopic and sonar doppler.
26038680|a|INTRODUCTION:    Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a degenerative disease that can cause loss of coordination of voluntary muscle movement such as that required for swallowing. AIMS:    The purposes of this cross-sectional and comparative case study were: (1) to assess the severity of dysphagia through a videofluoroscopic swallow study, and (2) to compare differences in frequency, intensity, and duration of sound waves produced during swallowing in normal and SCA patients by using sonar Doppler. METHOD:    During swallow evaluation using videofluoroscopy, a sonar Doppler transducer was placed on the right side of the neck, at the lateral edge of the trachea, just below the cricoid cartilage to capture the sounds of swallowing in 30 SCA patients and 30 controls. RESULT:    The prevalence in the dynamic evaluation of swallowing videofluoroscopy was by changes in the oral phase of swallowing. The analysis of variance of the averages found in each variable - frequency, intensity and duration of swallowing - shows there was a significant correlation when compared to the healthy individual curve. CONCLUSION:    The study demonstrates the prevalence of oral dysphagia observed in dynamic videofluoroscopic swallow evaluation. In patients with SCA, the mean initial frequency (IF), initial intensity (II), and final intensity (FI) were higher and the time (T) and peak frequency (PF) were lower, demonstrating a pattern of cricopharyngeal opening very close to that found in normal populations.

26015743|t|Pulmonary function test in formalin exposed and nonexposed subjects: A comparative study.
26015743|a|BACKGROUND: The main function of the lung is gas exchange, which can be assessed in several ways. A spirometer measures the flow and the volumes of the inspired and expired air. The thoracic and abdominal muscle strength plays an important role in pulmonary function and diffusing lung capacity. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of formalin exposure on the pulmonary function to compare with healthy individuals. To assess the chronic effects of formalin exposure on Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in the faculties, lab technicians and attender of the Department of Anatomy and Pathology of SRM Medical Hospital and Research Centre, Kattankulathur. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was carried out in 50 healthy formalin exposed subjects (at least 5 years exposure) from Department of Anatomy and Pathology of SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Kattankulathur and 50 healthy controls of same age group of this study were included after obtaining ethical clearance and consent 'Easy One Pro Spirometer (Ndd Medical Technologies, Cheshire SK 101LT, United Kingdom) was used to find out the PFT. RESULTS: Student's t-test was applied to compare the PFT parameters between formalin exposed and formalin nonexposed group. There was a significant difference in mean and standard deviation of pulmonary parameters with the P < 0.005 in formalin exposed, which shows that they have lesser ventilatory drive. CONCLUSION: The formalin exposed subjects in our study presented with a mixed disorder of both obstructive and restrictive type. We also found that there was a negative correlation of pulmonary function with that of the degree and duration of exposure to formalin.

26010762|t|Explaining pharmacophobia and pharmacophilia in psychiatric patients: relationship with treatment adherence.
26010762|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess psychiatric patient attitudes towards psychotropic medication and their association with adherence, as well as to identify the factors that influence these attitudes. METHODS: Nine hundred and forty nine consecutive psychiatric outpatients categorized as "pharmacophobic" or "pharmacophilic" according to the Drug Attitude Inventory were compared with regard to adherence to prescribed treatment, socio-demographic variables, clinical characteristics, health locus of control, self-efficacy, and psychological reactance. RESULTS: Seventy three per cent of psychiatric outpatients showed a "pharmacophilic" attitude and 15.5% "pharmacophobic" one. Patients' attitudes toward prescribed drug treatment were clearly related to self-reported treatment adherence. The pharmacophobic group registered significant worse adherence than the pharmacophilic patients. Psychiatric patients' attitudes to drugs were mediated by external health locus of control, cognitive psychological reactance, and self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: The encouragement of psychiatric patients' treatment adherence needs to include lack of coercion during prescription, a positive relationship with the prescriber, verbal persuasion, information containing vicarious experience, and the involvement of the patient in treatment decisions.

26013269|t|Spatial distribution, temporal variation and specificity of microhabitat of tropisternus species (coleoptera: hydrophilidae) in permanent ponds.
26013269|a|The spatial distribution and temporal variation of 11 species of Tropisternus were analyzed in two permanent ponds located in the province of Corrientes, Argentina. Samples were collected every 15  days, between October 2010 and March 2011. The species recorded were Tropisternus collaris (Fabricius), Tropisternus ovalis Castelnau, Tropisternus laevis (Sturm), Tropisternus lateralis limbatus (Brull  ), Tropisternus longispina Fern  ndez _ Bachmann, Tropisternus carinispina Orchymont, Tropisternus bourmeisteri Fern  ndez _ Bachmann, Tropisternus apicipalpis (Chevrolat), Tropisternus dilatatus Bruch, Tropisternus obesus Bruch, and Tropisternus ignoratus Knisch. The first four were present in higher proportions than the remaining during most of the study period. The spatial distribution of individuals was mostly related to the homogeneity or heterogeneity of the ecosystem in relation to microhabitats with aquatic vegetation: In ponds with different microhabitats, individuals were mainly aggregated, whereas in ponds with homogenous features, individuals were randomly distributed. However, when species were analyzed individually, the spatial distribution and the use of microhabitat by each species were different with respect to preference and behavior.

26009657|t|Inhibitory effect of curcumin on the contractility of isolated caprine detrusor muscle.
26009657|a|Curcumin is a naturally occurring compound which has been used in traditional medicine in India for a long time. This study investigated the ability of curcumin to inhibit the contractility of isolated caprine (goat) detrusor muscle. The ability of three concentrations of curcumin (30, 100 and 300   M) to inhibit the 100   M acetylcholine-induced contractility of the isolated caprine urinary bladder detrusor muscle was investigated. The effect of raising the concentration of acetylcholine from 100, 200 and 400   M to overcome the curcumin-induced inhibition of detrusor contractility and the effects of the reversal agents tetraethylammonium, a potassium channel blocker (100   M), glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker (10   M), and propranolol, a beta adrenergic receptor blocker (1   M), on the inhibitory effect of detrusor contractility was also studied. Curcumin caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of acetylcholine-induced contractility of the isolated detrusor muscle which was statistically significant at all three concentrations of curcumin used. This inhibition was partially overcome by raising the concentration of ACh to 200 and 400   M. The inhibition was overcome by the concurrent administration of tetraethylammonium. Glibenclamide reversed the inhibitory effect of 100   M curcumin, but not that of 300   M curcumin. Propranolol reversed the inhibitory effect of 100   M curcumin but not that of 300   M curcumin. These results suggest that curcumin inhibited the contractions of the isolated detrusor muscle. The results further suggest that the inhibitory effect is mediated by various mechanisms: stimulation of beta adrenergic receptors; an anticholinergic effect; and the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels.

26061860|t|Recruiting Primary Care Physicians to Teach Medical Students in the Ambulatory Setting: A Model of Protected Time, Allocated Money, and Faculty Development.
26061860|a|PROBLEM: Medical schools face barriers to recruiting physicians to teach in the ambulatory setting for many reasons, including time required to teach, loss of productivity when learners are present, and physicians' uncertainty about how to teach. APPROACH: In 2012, the primary care department of the University of Queensland-Ochsner Clinical School (UQ-OCS) implemented an innovative model for recruiting primary care physicians to teach students in their clinics. The model's three-pronged approach allows protected teaching time, allocates tuition money to reimburse physicians for teaching via educational value unit (EVU) tracking, and includes a faculty development program. OUTCOMES: In the first two years of EVU tracking (academic years 2012 and 2013), 5,530 EVUs were provided by 48 primary care faculty teaching 60 students at 11 sites. In academic year 2013, the first year in which tuition dollars were available to fund teaching by primary care faculty, over  120,000 in tuition money was transferred to the department to pay for EVUs. No faculty in 2012 or 2013 experienced a change in salary as a result of teaching activities. Faculty development workshops have been well attended. The general practice clerkship has been the top-rated third-year clerkship by students for the first three years of clinical rotations at the UQ-OCS. NEXT STEPS: A qualitative study to describe the barriers to and solutions for recruiting physicians to teach students in ambulatory settings is planned. Other studies will evaluate the effectiveness of faculty development efforts and the impact of students' presence on patients' access to clinic appointments.

26059210|t|Influence of niche similarity on hybridization between Myriophyllum sibiricum and M.  spicatum.
26059210|a|UNASSIGNED: The impact of ecological factors on natural hybridization is of widespread interest. Here, we asked whether climate niche influences hybridization between the two closely related plant species Myriophyllum sibiricum and M.  spicatum. Eight microsatellite loci and two chloroplast fragments were used to investigate the occurrence of hybridization between these two species in two co-occurring regions: north-east China (NEC) and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The climate niches of the species were quantified by principal component analysis with bioclimatic data, and niche comparisons were performed between the two species in each region. Reciprocal hybridization was observed, and M.  sibiricum was favoured as the maternal species. Furthermore, hybrids were rare in NEC but common in the QTP. Accordingly, in NEC, the two species were climatically distinct, and hybrids only occurred in the narrow geographical or ecological transition zone, whereas in the QTP, obvious niche overlaps were found for the two species, and hybrids occurred in multiple contact zones. This association between hybridization pattern and climate niche similarity suggests that the level of hybridization was promoted by niche overlap. Compared with the parental species, similar climate niches were found for the hybrid populations in the QTP, indicating that other environmental factors rather than climate were important for hybrid persistence. Our findings highlight the significance of climate niche with respect to hybridization patterns in plants.

26007205|t|Benchmark Outcomes for Pulmonary Valve Replacement Using The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Databases.
26007205|a|BACKGROUND: As less invasive alternatives to surgical pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) are being refined and evaluated, there is a need for benchmark data concerning outcomes from surgical PVR. METHODS: We examined in-hospital outcomes from surgical PVR in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (STS-CHSD) and Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (STS-ACSD) between 2007 and 2013, with a focus on patients likely to be eligible for transcatheter PVR (ie, >=  5 years age and >=  30 kg). Patient characteristics, morbidity, and mortality were described. RESULTS: The STS-CHSD included 6,431 eligible patients with a median age of 17 years (interquartile range [IQR], 14-25 years). Preoperative comorbidities were uncommon: arrhythmia (1.7%), renal failure (0.1%), endocarditis (0.3%), neurologic deficit (0.8%), and diabetes (0.5%). In-hospital mortality was 0.9%. A major complication occurred in 2.2%. The STS-ACSD included 3,352 eligible patients; the median age was 41 years (IQR, 30-55 years). Preoperative comorbidities were more common: arrhythmia (24.3%), renal failure (3.8%), endocarditis (12.2%), cerebrovascular disease (7.9%), and diabetes (10.9%). In-hospital mortality was 4.1%. A major complication occurred in 20.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary outcomes from surgical PVR include a low risk of in-hospital death or major complications. Patients in the STS-ACSD are older and  have an increased prevalence of preoperative factors, which may contribute to higher morbidity and mortality.

26045557|t|Engineering a nickase on the homing endonuclease I-DmoI scaffold.
26045557|a|UNASSIGNED: Homing endonucleases are useful tools for genome modification due to their capability to recognize and cleave specifically large DNA targets. These endonucleases generate a DNA double-strand break that can be repaired by the DNA damage response machinery. The break can be repaired by homologous recombination, an error-free mechanism, or by non-homologous end joining, a process susceptible to introduce errors in the repaired sequence. The type of DNA cleavage might alter the balance between these two alternatives. The use of nickases producing a specific single strand break instead of a double-strand break could be an approach to reduce the toxicity associated to non-homologous end joining by promoting the use of homologous recombination to repair the cleavage of a single DNA break. Taking advantage of the sequential DNA cleavage mechanism of I-DmoI LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease we have developed a new variant that is able to cut preferentially the coding DNA strand generating a nicked DNA target. Our structural and biochemical analysis shows that by decoupling the action of the catalytic residues acting on each strand, we can inhibit one of them while keeping the other functional.

26071926|t|Expression and partial characterisation of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus non-structural proteins.
26071926|a|UNASSIGNED: The intracellular replication and molecular virulence mechanisms of Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) are poorly understood, mainly due to the lack of an effective cell culture system for this virus. To increase our understanding of RHDV molecular biology, the subcellular localisation of recombinant non-structural RHDV proteins was investigated in transiently transfected rabbit kidney (RK-13) cells. We provide evidence for oligomerisation of p23, and an ability of the viral protease to cleave the p16:p23 junction in trans, outside the context of the nascent polyprotein chain. Notably, expression of the viral polymerase alone and in the context of the entire RHDV polyprotein resulted in a redistribution of the Golgi network. This suggests that, similar to other positive-strand RNA viruses, RHDV may recruit membranes of the secretory pathway during replication, and that the viral polymerase may play a critical role during this process.

26089018|t|A social path to functioning in schizophrenia: From social self-efficacy through negative symptoms to social functional capacity.
26089018|a|UNASSIGNED: Self-efficacy is important to functioning in schizophrenia. The exact pathway is less clear, possibly because most studies used composite rather than domain-specific self-efficacy scores. We examined if a specific measure of social self-efficacy is more important to a social (from negative symptoms to social functional capacity) compared to a non-social (from neurocognition to non-social functional capacity) path to functioning. Associations between social self-efficacy and negative symptoms, neurocognition and social and non-social functional capacity were examined in a cross-sectional study of schizophrenia (n=51). Two models were investigated using bootstrapping methods to test for mediation. In Model I, social self-efficacy was entered as a mediator; in Model II as a predictor. Social self-efficacy was unrelated to neurocognition and non-social functional capacity. Associations with negative symptoms and social functional capacity were significant. Negative symptoms were found to mediate between social self-efficacy and social functional capacity. Support was found for a social path to functioning in schizophrenia, going from social self-efficacy through negative symptoms to social functional capacity. Our results are consistent with the idea that negative symptoms can develop as a reaction to self-defeatist beliefs. Future studies should use domain-specific self-efficacy to further understand predictors of functioning in schizophrenia.

26087913|t|The Source and Impact of Specific Parameters that Enhance Well-Being in Daily Life.
26087913|a|UNASSIGNED: The purpose of this study was to review four parameters (forgiveness, gratitude, hope and empathy) frequently noted when evaluating well-being. We reviewed clinical studies from 1966 to present. We included 63 articles. All four of the parameters were shown to generally improve an individual's well-being. These parameters demonstrated a positive influence within more specific societal issues including improvement in social relationships, delinquent behavior and physical health. These parameters were generally derived from training and religion. This study suggests that these parameters may improve either one of general well-being, pro-social and positive relational behavior and demonstrate positive health effects.

26088070|t|Minimally Invasive Surgical Treatment for Kidney Stone Disease.
26088070|a|Minimally invasive interventions for stone disease in the United States are mainly founded on 3 surgical procedures: extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopic lithotripsy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. With the advancement of technology, treatment has shifted toward less invasive strategies and away from open or laparoscopic surgery. The treatment chosen for a patient with stones is based on the stone and patient characteristics. Each of the minimally invasive techniques uses an imaging source, either fluoroscopy or ultrasound, to localize the stone and an energy source to fragment the stone. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy uses a shock wave energy source generated outside the body to fragment the stone. In contrast, with ureteroscopy, laser energy is placed directly on the stone using a ureteroscope that visualizes the stone. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy requires dilation of a tract through the back into the renal pelvis so that instruments can be inserted directly onto the stone to fragment or pulverize it. The success of the surgical intervention relies on performing the least invasive technique with the highest success of stone removal.

26019227|t|Body Management: Mesenchymal Stem Cells Control the Internal Regenerator.
26019227|a|UNASSIGNED: SummaryIt has been assumed that adult tissues cannot regenerate themselves. With the current understanding that every adult tissue has its own intrinsic progenitor or stem cell, it is now clear that almost all tissues have regenerative potential partially related to their innate turnover dynamics. Moreover, it appears that a separate class of local cells originating as perivascular cells appears to provide regulatory oversight for localized tissue regeneration. The management of this regeneration oversight has a profound influence on the use of specific cells for cell therapies as a health care delivery tool set. The multipotent mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), now renamed the medicinal signaling cell, predominantly arises from pericytes released from broken and inflamed blood vessels and appears to function as both an immunomodulatory and a regeneration mediator. MSCs are being tested for their management capabilities to produce therapeutic outcomes in more than 480 clinical trials for a wide range of clinical conditions. Local MSCs function by managing the body's primary repair and regeneration activities. Supplemental MSCs can be provided from either endogenous or exogenous sources of either allogeneic or autologous origin. This MSC-based therapy has the potential to change how health care is delivered. These medicinal cells are capable of sensing their surroundings. Also, by using its complex signaling circuitry, these cells organize site-specific regenerative responses as if these therapeutic cells were well-programmed modern computers. Given these facts, it appears that we are entering a new age of cellular medicine.

26001017|t|Collective Ion Dynamics in Liquid Zinc: Evidence for Complex Dynamics in a Non-Free-Electron Liquid Metal.
26001017|a|UNASSIGNED: A detailed inelastic neutron scattering investigation of the THz dynamics of liquid zinc is presented. The observed Q dependence clearly reveals the existence of a complex dynamics made up of two distinct excitations. The highest energy mode is the prolongation of the longitudinal acoustic density fluctuations whereas the comparison with the phonon dynamics of crystalline hcp zinc suggests a transverse acousticlike nature for the second one. This mode seems related to peculiar anisotropic interactions, possibly connected to the behavior of the crystalline phase.

26017332|t|Motility of Fasciola hepatica miracidia assessed with a computer-assisted sperm analyser.
26017332|a|The motility parameters of Fasciola hepatica miracidia were assessed at different temperatures and times post-hatching using computer-assisted sperm analysis. Eggs were incubated at 22  C or 25  C for 14 days. Five motion parameters were evaluated at different incubation temperatures up to 10  h post-hatching. No differences were observed in the percentage that hatched after incubation at the two different temperatures. However, the straight-line velocity of miracidia following incubation at 22  C was significantly different from that observed at 25  C (P<  0.01). All miracidium motion parameters at different post-hatching temperatures showed an overall decrease at the end of the experiment. Those miracidia hatching from eggs incubated at 25  C had a higher velocity of 1673.3   m/s compared with 1553.3   m/s at 22  C. Velocity parameters increased as the post-hatching temperature increased from 22  C to 37  C.

26016825|a|UNASSIGNED: Cardiac transplantation is definitive therapy for selected patients with advanced heart failure who have exhausted other options. The major limitations to expanding the number of cardiac transplants is the shortage of donor organs. and the number of heart transplant has plateaued at around 4000 per year (1). This has led to the expansion of the utilization of mechanical circulatory support, especially in North America, parts of Europe, Japan and Australia (1). This article is protected by copyright.

26020405|t|Clinical Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography or Exercise Electrocardiogram in Individuals Without Known Cardiovascular Disease.
26020405|a|UNASSIGNED: It is not clear whether screening by coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) and/or exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) can improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs in individuals without known cardiovascular disease (CVD).In total, 71,811 consecutive individuals without known CVD who underwent general health examinations were enrolled. Using propensity-score matching according to screening tests, 1-year clinical outcomes and 6-month total and coronary artery disease-related medical costs were analyzed in separate groups: group 1 (CCTA [n=2578] vs no screening [n=5146]), group 2 (exercise ECG [n=2898] vs no screening [n=5796]), and group 3 (CCTA and exercise ECG [n=2003] vs no screening [n=4006]).There were no significant differences in the composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in each matched group: group 1 (0.35% vs 0.45%, P=0.501), group 2 (0.14% vs 0.28%, P=0.157), and group 3 (0.25% vs 0.27%, P=0.858). However, revascularization was more frequent in the CCTA screening groups: group 1 (2.02% vs 0.45%, P<0.001) and group 3 (1.40% vs 0.45%, P<0.001). Matched screening groups had higher 6-month total and coronary artery disease-related medical costs: group 1 ( 777 vs  603, P<0.001 and  177 vs  39, P<0.001), group 2 ( 544 vs  492, P=0.045 and  12 vs  15, P=0.611), and group 3 ( 705 vs  627, P=0.090 and  135 vs  35, P<0.001).In individuals without known CVD, CCTA screening with or without exercise ECG led to more frequent revascularization at the expense of higher medical costs, but did not decrease the 1-year risk of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke.

26020373|t|Pediatric Functional Constipation Gastrointestinal Symptom Profile Compared to Healthy Controls.
26020373|a|OBJECTIVES: Patient-reported outcomes are necessary to evaluate the gastrointestinal symptom profile of patients with functional constipation. Study objectives were to compare the gastrointestinal symptom profile of pediatric patients with functional constipation to matched healthy controls with the PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Gastrointestinal Worry Scales and to establish clinical interpretability in functional constipation through identification of minimal important difference (MID) scores. The secondary objective compared the symptom profile of patients with functional constipation to patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 116 pediatric patients with functional constipation and 188 parents. Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea were administered along with Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. 341 healthy children families and 43 IBS patient families completed the scales. RESULTS: A broad profile of gastrointestinal symptoms and worry were reported by patients with functional constipation in comparison to healthy controls (P<0.001) with large effect sizes (>0.80) across the majority of symptom domains. Patients with IBS manifested a broader symptom profile than functional constipation, with differences for stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, and worry about stomachaches, with similar constipation scores. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with functional constipation report a broad gastrointestinal symptom profile in comparison to healthy controls, and only somewhat fewer symptoms than patients with IBS, highlighting the critical need for more efficacious interventions to achieve healthy functioning.

26016321|t|[Effects of activation of kappa-opioid receptors on the behavior at the postnatal development of the stress reactivity systems].
26016321|a|It is known that stress changes state and reactivity of humoral systems of stress, particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system (HPA) and the dynorphin-K-opioid system (DKOS) in any age periods, including ones of early postnatal development. Supposedly these changes are underlying some disorders. Difference in state and reactivity of the HPA system is well established. But the role of DKOS is not clear. Further study of this requires summarizing of the literature data on physiology of DKOS activation and ethological features of the activation in different periods of postnatal development. It is possible to conclude that the mode of reaction to stimulation of the DKOS differs in the early development in contrast to adult animals. The mode of reaction can be changed in relation to the periods of development of the system of stress-reactivity and can depend on prior activation of the stress system in a particular period.

26107641|t|Prevalence and Predictors of Early Cardiovascular Events after Kidney Transplantation: Evaluation of Pre-Transplant Cardiovascular Work-Up.
26107641|a|INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality after renal transplantation. The purpose of this study was to analyze cardiovascular risk factors at transplantation, occurrence of cardiovascular events in the first year after transplantation and evaluate pre-transplant work-up. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In total, 244 renal transplant recipients older than 50 years were included. The results of pre-transplant work-up, including clinical evaluation, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, myocardial perfusion testing and coronary angiography were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients had multiple risk factors at inclusion on renal transplantation waiting list as high blood pressure (94.7%), dyslipidemia (81.1%), smoking (45.3%), diabetes (23.6%), past history of cardiovascular disease (21.3%) and obesity (12.7%). Following transplantation, 15.5% (n = 38) of patients experienced a cardiovascular event, including 2.8% (n = 7) acute coronary syndrome, 5.8% (n = 14) isolated increase in troponin level and 5.3% (n = 13) new onset atrial fibrillation. The pre-transplant parameters associated with a cardiovascular event were a past medical history of cardiovascular disease (HR = 2.06 [1.06-4.03], p = 0.03), echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (HR = 2.04 [1.04-3.98], p = 0.037) and abnormal myocardial perfusion testing (HR = 2.25 [1.09 -5.96], p = 0.03). Pre-transplantation evaluation allowed the diagnosis of unknown coronary artery lesions in 8.9% of patients.

26027356|a|An anaerobic microbial consortium that degrades benzene- and p-toluenesulfonate to form methane and fatty acids has been produced. Pure cultures of three strains of anaerobic spore-forming bacteria Clostridium spp., as well as the sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio sp., were isolated and characterized. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains showed that pure cultures of clostridia strains 14, 24, and 21 are close to Clostridium lituseburense DSM 797T, C. sartagoforme DSM 1292T, and C. pascui DSM 10365T, and the sulfate-reducing strain SR1 is genotypically closer to Desulfovibrio aminophilus ALA-3T. Preliminary characterization of isolated bacteria makes it possible to assume that these are new species of the genera Clostridium and Desulfovibrio, the distinctive feature of which is the ability to incorporate aromatic sulfonates in their metabolisms.

26030915|t|Factors of Force Potentiation Induced by Stretch-Shortening Cycle in Plantarflexors.
26030915|a|UNASSIGNED: Muscle force is potentiated by countermovement; this phenomenon is called stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) effect. In this study, we examined the factors strongly related to SSC effect in vivo, focusing on tendon elongation, preactivation, and residual force enhancement. Twelve healthy men participated in this study. Ankle joint angle was passively moved by a dynamometer, with a range of motion from 15   dorsiflexion (DF) to 15   plantarflexion (PF). Muscle contraction was evoked by electrical stimulation, with stimulation timing adjusted to elicit three types of contraction: (1) concentric contraction without preliminary contraction (CON), (2) concentric contraction after preliminary eccentric contraction (ECC), and (3) concentric contraction after preliminary isometric contraction (ISO). Joint torque was recorded at DF5  , PF0  , and PF5  , respectively. SSC effect was calculated as the ratio of joint torque obtained in ECC or ISO with respect to that obtained in CON at the aforementioned three joint angles. SSC effect was prominent in the first half of movement in both ECC (DF5  , 329.3    101.2%; PF0  , 159.2    29.4%; PF5  , 125.5    20.8%) and ISO (DF5  , 276.4    87.0%; PF0  , 134.5    24.5%; PF5  , 106.8    18.0%) conditions. SSC effect was significantly larger in ECC than in ISO at all joint angles (P < 0.001). Even without preliminary eccentric contraction (i.e., ISO condition), SSC effect was clearly large, indicating that a significant part of SSC effect is derived from preactivation. However, the active lengthening-induced force potentiation mechanism (residual force enhancement) also contributes to SSC effect.

26030143|t|The Frequency of Patient-Initiated Violence and Its Psychological Impact on Physicians in China: A Cross-Sectional Study.
26030143|a|INTRODUCTION: In China, the severity of medical disputes has greatly increased during the past two decades, which has caused various adverse outcomes for health professionals. Previous research on violence in healthcare settings has primarily examined the occurrence of patient-initiated violence and its effects on physicians, but few studies have focused on the impact of the extent of physicians' exposure to violence. This study examined the different frequency levels of specific types of violence and their relationships to physicians' psychological wellbeing, including emotional exhaustion (EE), job satisfaction (JS), and intention to leave (IL). METHODS: Using a stratified random sampling method, the participants were drawn from 123 public hospitals in Shanghai, Hubei Province, and Gansu Province in China, and 1,656 completed questionnaires were collected. Chi-square test, analysis of variance, and mixed linear model were employed in the analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that the rate of exposure to verbal abuse (VA) was the highest (92.75%), followed by threats of assault (TA, 88.10%) and physical assaults (PA, 81.04%). Physicians' reported high-frequency exposure to VA, TA, and PA was 35.14%, 27.72%, and 19.32%, respectively. The results indicated that exposure to violence significantly affected EE, JS, and IL, and the intensity of the harm of high-frequency exposure was several times stronger than that of low-frequency exposure. Interestingly, we found that VA produced a greater adverse impact on physicians' EE and satisfaction with work (JS-1) than did TA or PA. This finding may be attributed to the fact that physicians are more likely to be exposed to a high frequency of VA, and the effect of high-frequency exposure is much stronger. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that decreasing violent incidents and creating a safer work environment for physicians should be a top priority for both government and society.

26032278|t|The role of community, family, peer, and school factors in group bullying: implications for school-based intervention.
26032278|a|BACKGROUND: Although an ecological perspective suggests the importance of multiple levels of intervention, most bullying research has emphasized individual- and school-focused strategies. This study investigated community and family factors that influence school efforts to reduce odds of group bullying behavior and victimization. METHODS: We used multilevel logistic regression to analyze data from the 2009 Youth in Iceland population school survey (N = 7084, response rate: 83.5%, 50.8% girls). RESULTS: Parental support and time spent with parents were protective against group bullying behavior while worsening relationships with teachers and disliking school increased the likelihood of such behavior. Knowing kids in the area increased the likelihood of group bullying while intergenerational closure was a protective factor. Normlessness was consistently positively related to group bullying. We found no indication of higher-level relationships across the bullying models. Parental support was protective against victimization. Disliking school, intergenerational closure, and anomie/normlessness were strongly and negatively related to victimization. We found some indication of multilevel relationships for victimization. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support efforts to increase family and community connection, closure, and support as a part of school-based intervention. These factors become more important as young people participate in or experience greater odds of group bullying behavior and victimization.

26039215|t|Immune tolerance in recipients of combined haploidentical bone marrow and kidney transplantation.
26039215|a|UNASSIGNED: The success of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been limited by transplant-associated toxicities related to the conditioning regimens used and to graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). The frequency and severity of GVHD observed when extensive HLA barriers are transgressed has greatly impeded the routine use of extensively HLA-mismatched HCT. Allogeneic HCT also has potential as an approach to organ allograft tolerance induction, but this potential has not been previously realized because of the toxicity associated with traditional conditioning. This paper reviews an approach to HCT involving reduced intensity conditioning that demonstrated sufficient safety in patients with hematologic malignancies, even in the HLA-mismatched transplant setting, to be applied for the induction of kidney allograft tolerance in humans with no other indication for HCT. These studies provided the first successful example of intentional organ allograft tolerance induction across HLA barriers in humans. Current data and hypotheses on the mechanisms of tolerance in these patients are reviewed.

26037794|t|Improve the prevention of sudden cardiac arrest in emerging countries: the Improve SCA clinical study design.
26037794|a|AIMS: This study aims to demonstrate that primary prevention (PP) patients with one or more additional risk factors are at a similar risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias when compared with secondary prevention (SP) patients, and would receive similar benefit from an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), or cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) implant. The study evaluates the benefits of therapy for high-risk patients in countries where defibrillation therapy for PP of SCA is underutilized. METHODS: Enrolment will consist of 4800 ICD-eligible patients from Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Upon enrolment, patients will be categorized as SP or PP. Primary prevention patients will be assessed for additional risk factors: syncope/pre-syncope, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, frequent premature ventricular contractions, and low left ventricular ejection fraction. Those PP patients with one or more risk factors will be categorized as '1.5' patients. Implant of an ICD/CRT-D will be left to the patient and/or physician's discretion. The primary endpoint will compare the appropriate ICD therapy rate between SP and 1.5 patients. The secondary endpoint compares mortality between 1.5 implanted and non-implanted patients. CONCLUSION: The Improve SCA study will investigate a subset of PP patients, believed to be at similar risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias as SP patients. Results may help clinicians identify and refer the highest risk PP patients for ICDs, help local societies expand guidelines to include PP of SCA utilizing ICDs, and provide additional geographical-relevant evidence to allow patients to make an informed decision whether to receive an ICD.

26036675|t|Economic evaluation favours physiotherapy but not corticosteroid injection as a first-line intervention for chronic lateral epicondylalgia: evidence from a randomised clinical trial.
26036675|a|AIM: To determine the cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid injection, physiotherapy and a combination of these interventions, compared to a reference group receiving a blinded placebo injection. METHODS: 165 adults with unilateral lateral epicondylalgia of longer than 6   weeks duration from Brisbane, Australia, were randomised for concealed allocation to saline injection (placebo), corticosteroid injection, saline injection plus physiotherapy (eight sessions of elbow manipulation and exercise) or corticosteroid injection plus physiotherapy. Costs to society and health-related quality of life (estimated by EuroQol-5D) over the 1   year follow-up were used to generate incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) ratios for each intervention relative to placebo. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis was possible for 154 (93%) of trial participants. Physiotherapy was more costly, but was the only intervention that produced a statistically significant improvement in quality of life relative to placebo (MD, 95% CI 0.035, 0.003  to 0.068). Similar cost/QALY ratios were found for physiotherapy ( A29   343; GBP18   962) and corticosteroid injection ( A31   750; GBP20   518); however, the probability of being more cost-effective than placebo at values above  A50   000 per quality-adjusted life year was 81% for physiotherapy and 53% for corticosteroid injection. Cost/QALY was far greater for a combination of corticosteroid injection and physiotherapy ( A228   000; GBP147   340). SUMMARY: Physiotherapy was a cost-effective treatment for lateral epicondylalgia. Corticosteroid injection was associated with greater variability, and a lower probability of being cost-effective if a willingness to pay threshold of  A50   000 is assumed. A combination of corticosteroid injection and physiotherapy was ineffective and cost-ineffective. Physiotherapy, not corticosteroid injection, should be considered as a first-line intervention for lateral epicondylalgia.

26032780|t|"It's very complicated": a qualitative study of medicines management in intermediate care facilities in Northern Ireland.
26032780|a|BACKGROUND: Intermediate care (IC) describes a range of services targeted at older people, aimed at preventing unnecessary hospitalisation, promoting faster recovery from illness and maximising independence. Older people are at increased risk of medication-related adverse events, but little is known about the provision of medicines management services in IC facilities. This study aimed to describe the current provision of medicines management services in IC facilities in Northern Ireland (NI) and to explore healthcare workers' (HCWs) and patients' views of, and attitudes towards these services and the IC concept. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted, recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a constant comparative approach with HCWs and patients from IC facilities in NI. RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 25 HCWs and 18 patients from 12 IC facilities in NI. Three themes were identified: 'concept and reality', 'setting and supply' and 'responsibility and review'. A mismatch between the concept of IC and the reality was evident. The IC facility setting dictated prescribing responsibilities and the supply of medicines, presenting challenges for HCWs. A lack of a standardised approach to responsibility for the provision of medicines management services including clinical review was identified. Whilst pharmacists were not considered part of the multidisciplinary team, most HCWs recognised a need for their input. Medicines management was not a concern for the majority of IC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Medicines management services are not integral to IC and medicine-related challenges are frequently encountered. Integration of pharmacists into the multidisciplinary team could potentially improve medicines management in IC.

26034214|t|A Murine Model of Chemotherapy-induced ExPEC Translocation.
26034214|a|UNASSIGNED: E. coli is a major cause of life-threatening infections in patients with neutropenia, particularly those receiving chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer. In most cases, these infections originate from opportunistic strains living within the patient's gastrointestinal tract which then translocate to major organ systems. There are no animal models that faithfully recapitulate these infections, and, as such, the host or bacterial factors that govern this process remain unidentified. We present here a novel model of chemotherapy-induced bacterial translocation of E. coli. Oral gavage of BALB/c mice with a clinical isolate of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) leads to stable and long-term colonization of the murine intestine. Following the induction of neutropenia with the chemotherapeutic drug cyclophosphamide, ExPEC translocate from the intestine to the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys with concomitant morbidity in infected animals. Translocation can also occur in mice bearing mammary tumors, even in the absence of chemotherapy. Translocation of ExPEC is also associated with an increase of the diversity of bacterial DNA detected in the blood. This is the first report of a chemotherapy-based animal model of ExPEC translocation in cancerous mice, a system that can be readily used to identify important virulence factors for this process.

26035774|t|Advanced aqueous rechargeable lithium battery using nanoparticulate LiTi2(PO4)3/C as a superior anode.
26035774|a|Poor cycling performance arising from the instability of anode is still a main challenge for aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries (ARLB). In the present work, a high performance LiTi2(PO4)3/C composite has been achieved by a novel and facile preparation method associated with an in-situ carbon coating approach. The LiTi2(PO4)3/C nanoparticles show high purity and the carbon layer is very uniform. When used as an anode material, the ARLB of LiTi2(PO4)3/C//LiMn2O4 delivered superior cycling stability with a capacity retention of 90% after 300 cycles at 30   mA   g(-1) and 84% at 150   mA   g(-1) over 1300 cycles. It also demonstrated excellent rate capability with reversible discharge capacities of 115 and 89   mAh   g(-1) (based on the mass of anode) at 15 and 1500   mA   g(-1), respectively. The superior electrochemical properties should be mainly ascribed to the high performance of LiTi2(PO4)3/C anode, benefiting from its nanostructure, high-quality carbon coating, appropriate crystal structure and excellent electrode surface stability as verified by Raman spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements.

26034574|t|Molecular characterization and embryonic origin of the eyes in the common house spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum.
26034574|a|BACKGROUND: Two visual systems are present in most arthropod groups: median and lateral eyes. Most of our current knowledge about the developmental and molecular mechanisms involved in eye formation in arthropods comes from research in the model system Drosophila melanogaster. Here, a core set of retinal determination genes, namely, sine-oculis (so), eyes absent (eya), dachshund (dac), and the two pax6 orthologues eyeless (ey) and twin of eyeless (toy) govern early retinal development. By contrast, not much is known about the development of the up-to-eight eyes present in spiders. Therefore, we analyzed the embryonic expression of core retinal determination genes in the common house spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum. RESULTS: We show that the anlagen of the median and lateral eyes in P. tepidariorum originate from different regions of the non-neurogenic ectoderm in the embryonic head. The median eyes are specified as two individual anlagen in an anterior median position in the developing head and subsequently move to their final position following extensive morphogenetic movements of the non-neurogenic ectoderm. The lateral eyes develop from a more lateral position. Intriguingly, they are specified as a unique field of cells that splits into the three individual lateral eyes during late embryonic development. Using gene expression analyses, we identified a unique combination of determination gene expression in the anlagen of the lateral and median eyes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study of retinal determination genes in the common house spider P. tepidariorum represents the first comprehensive analysis of the well-known retinal determination genes in arthropods outside insects. The development of the individual lateral eyes via the subdivision of one single eye primordium might be the vestige of a larger composite eye anlage, and thus supports the notion that the composite eye is the plesiomorphic state of the lateral eyes in arthropods. The molecular distinction of the two visual systems is similar to the one described for compound eyes and ocelli in Drosophila, suggesting that a unique core determination network for median and lateral eyes, respectively, might have been in place already in the last common ancestor of spiders and insects.

26004232|t|Macrophage repolarization with targeted alginate nanoparticles containing IL-10 plasmid DNA for the treatment of experimental arthritis.
26004232|a|UNASSIGNED: In this study, we have shown for the first time the effectiveness of a non-viral gene transfection strategy to re-polarize macrophages from M1 to M2 functional sub-type for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokine encoding plasmid DNA was successfully encapsulated into non-condensing alginate based nanoparticles and the surface of the nano-carriers was modified with tuftsin peptide to achieve active macrophage targeting. Enhanced localization of tuftsin-modified alginate nanoparticles was observed in the inflamed paws of arthritic rats upon intraperitoneal administration. Importantly, targeted nanoparticle treatment was successful in reprogramming macrophage phenotype balance as    66% of total synovial macrophages from arthritic rats treated with the IL-10 plasmid DNA loaded tuftsin/alginate nanoparticles were in the M2 state compared to    9% of macrophages in the M2 state from untreated arthritic rats. Treatment significantly reduced systemic and joint tissue pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6) expression and prevented the progression of inflammation and joint damage as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging and histology. Treatment enabled animals to retain their mobility throughout the course of study, whereas untreated animals suffered from impaired mobility. Overall, this study demonstrates that targeted alginate nanoparticles loaded with IL-10 plasmid DNA can efficiently re-polarize macrophages from an M1 to an M2 state, offering a novel treatment paradigm for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.

26034988|t|Effects of assimilable organic carbon and free chlorine on bacterial growth in drinking water.
26034988|a|Assimilable organic carbon (AOC) is one of the most important factors affecting the re-growth of microorganisms in drinking water. High AOC concentrations result in biological instability, but disinfection kills microbes to ensure the safety of drinking water. Free chlorine is an important oxidizing agent used during the disinfection process. Therefore, we explored the combined effects of AOC and free chlorine on bacterial growth in drinking water using flow cytometry (FCM). The initial AOC concentration was 168  g.L-1 in all water samples. Without free chlorine, the concentrations of intact bacteria increased but the level of AOC decreased. The addition of sodium hypochlorite caused an increase and fluctuation in AOC due to the oxidation of organic carbon. The concentrations of intact bacteria decreased from 1.1*105 cells.mL-1 to 2.6*104 cells.mL-1 at an initial free chlorine dose of 0.6 mg.L-1 to 4.8*104 cells.mL-1 at an initial free chlorine dose of 0.3 mg.L-1 due to free chlorine originating from sodium hypochlorite. Additionally, free chlorine might be more obviously affected AOC concentrations than microbial growth did. These results suggested that AOC and free chlorine might have combined effects on microbial growth. In this study, our results showed concentrations determined by FCM were higher than those by HPC, which indicated that some E. coli detected by FCM might not be detected using HPC in drinking water. The level of free chlorine might restrain the consumption of AOC by inhibiting the growth of E. coli; on the other hand, chlorination might increase the level of AOC, thereby increase the potential for microbial growth in the drinking water network.

26035870|t|Deletion of the App-Runx1 region in mice models human partial monosomy 21.
26035870|a|Partial monosomy 21 (PM21) is a rare chromosomal abnormality that is characterized by the loss of a variable segment along human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). The clinical phenotypes of this loss are heterogeneous and range from mild alterations to lethal consequences, depending on the affected region of Hsa21. The most common features include intellectual disabilities, craniofacial dysmorphology, short stature, and muscular and cardiac defects. As a complement to human genetic approaches, our team has developed new monosomic mouse models that carry deletions on Hsa21 syntenic regions in order to identify the dosage-sensitive genes that are responsible for the symptoms. We focus here on the Ms5Yah mouse model, in which a 7.7-Mb region has been deleted from the App to Runx1 genes. Ms5Yah mice display high postnatal lethality, with a few surviving individuals showing growth retardation, motor coordination deficits, and spatial learning and memory impairments. Further studies confirmed a gene dosage effect in the Ms5Yah hippocampus, and pinpointed disruptions of pathways related to cell adhesion (involving App, Cntnap5b, Lgals3bp, Mag, Mcam, Npnt, Pcdhb2, Pcdhb3, Pcdhb4, Pcdhb6, Pcdhb7, Pcdhb8, Pcdhb16 and Vwf). Our PM21 mouse model is the first to display morphological abnormalities and behavioural phenotypes similar to those found in affected humans, and it therefore demonstrates the major contribution that the App-Runx1 region has in the pathophysiology of PM21.

26030934|t|Clinical evaluation of a silverimpregnated foam dressing in paediatric partial-thickness burns.
26030934|a|OBJECTIVE: MepilexAg, a silver-impregnated foam dressing, was introduced to our institution in 2007 and our outcomes in the treatment of paediatric burns were observed to improve significantly. In order to confirm these observations, we wanted to evaluate the results of using the silver-impregnated foam dressing in partial-thickness paediatric burns.Method: In this retrospective, study, the St. Christopher's Hospital burn registry was used to identify subjects, who were otherwise in excellent health at baseline, over an 18-month period,. Outcomes included length of stay, intravenous narcotic use, and time to healing. No direct comparative studies were performed. This was followed by a non-comparative prospective study involving 22 paediatric patients, aged 1-4 years, with partial-thickness burns. This was a sub-study of a larger randomized controlled trial involving adults with partial-thickness burns, comparing the silver-impregnated foam dressing with Silvadene. RESULTS: In the retrospective part of the study, the silver-impregnated foam dressing was used successfully for the treatment of partial-thickness paediatric burns, with few complications and infections, allowing a shorter hospital stay, fewer dressings, and less pain medication than for historical controls. In the non-comparative prospective study, of 22 paediatric patients 50% healed completely within I week of treatment. The mean length of stay was 3.77 days and the mean number of dressings used was 1.64.Aithough narcotic usage was not assessed, patient surveys showed stinging or burning to be recorded as 'never' in 13 patients, 'rarely' in 8 patients, and 'sometimes' in I patient. CONCLUSION: The silver-impregnated foam dressing is effective and safe for use in partial-thickness paediatric burns, eliminating the need for daily dressings.

26002917|t|The matricellular protein CCN1 controls retinal angiogenesis by targeting VEGF, Src homology 2 domain phosphatase-1 and Notch signaling.
26002917|a|UNASSIGNED: Physiological angiogenesis depends on the highly coordinated actions of multiple angiogenic regulators. CCN1 is a secreted cysteine-rich and integrin-binding matricellular protein required for proper cardiovascular development. However, our understanding of the cellular origins and activities of this molecule is incomplete. Here, we show that CCN1 is predominantly expressed in angiogenic endothelial cells (ECs) at the leading front of actively growing vessels in the mouse retina. Endothelial deletion of CCN1 in mice using a Cre/Lox system is associated with EC hyperplasia, loss of pericyte coverage and formation of dense retinal vascular networks lacking the normal hierarchical arrangement of arterioles, capillaries and venules. CCN1 is a product of an immediate-early gene that is transcriptionally induced in ECs in response to stimulation by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We found that CCN1 activity is integrated with VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) activation and downstream signaling pathways required for tubular network formation. CCN1-integrin binding increased the expression of and association between Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and VEGF-R2 which leads to rapid dephosphorylation of VEGF-R2 tyrosine preventing EC hyperproliferation. Predictably, CCN1 further brings receptors/signaling molecules into proximity that are otherwise spatially separated. Furthermore, CCN1 induces integrin-dependent Notch activation in cultured ECs and its targeted gene inactivation in vivo alters Notch-dependent vascular specification and remodeling suggesting that functional levels of Notch signaling requires CCN1 activity. These data highlight novel functions of CCN1 as a naturally optimized molecule fine controlling key processes in physiological angiogenesis and safeguarding against aberrant angiogenic responses.

26012251|t|Bilirubin degradation in methanol induced by continuous UV-B irradiation: a UHPLC--ESI-MS study.
26012251|a|Degradation of bilirubin in aerobic methanol solution by continuous UV-B irradiation has been investigated in this work. The purpose of this study was to shed more light on bilirubin interaction with the UV-B component of natural sunlight, since bilirubin is a very efficient UV-B absorber located in the skin epidermis. The degradation products have been detected and studied by a combined method of Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS). Bilirubin, a toxic pigment which itself is a product of (hemoglobin) degradation in organisms, undergoes its own degradation under aerobic conditions of UV-B continuous irradiation (e.g. photooxidation) that can be partly self-sensitized. Two dipyrrolic structures have been identified as a result of the bilirubin degradation, not including the bilirubin derivative biliverdin whose increase in the irradiated system is synchronous with a time dynamics of bilirubin degradation. It appears that one of dipyrrolic products originates directly from bilirubin and biliverdin molecules, while the other one is probably connected to bilirubin self-sensitized degradation. The precursor role of biliverdin in the degradation process--related to the detected dipyrroles--has not been confirmed.

26006049|t|European Union funded project on the development of a whole complement deficiency screening ELISA-A story of success and an exceptional manager: Mohamed R. Daha.
26006049|a|UNASSIGNED: A whole complement ELISA-based assay kit, primarily designed to screen for deficiencies in components of the complement system was developed during a European Union grant involving more than a dozen European scientists and a small-medium enterprise company (Wieslab, which later merged into Eurodiagnostica). The consortium was led by Prof. Mohamed R. Daha who had already guided a preceding European grant which prepared the ground for this endeavor to create a novel and sophisticated complement measurement tool. The final result of the grant was a scientific publication (Seelen et al., 2005, J. Immunol. Methods 296, 187-198) and a commercially available complement deficiency screening kit, WIESLAB(  ) Complement system Screen. Thereafter, the group decided to carry on with a grant, located at Innsbruck Medical University, and supported by royalties and unrestricted educational grants from Eurodiagnostica, Malm  , entitled "Search for Applications for WIESLAB(  ) Complement system Screen (SAW)" with the aim to look for further applications of this assay. During the latter project the group organized several scientific meetings aimed at evaluating the use of the assay as well as developing further branches of its platform. A look back over almost two decades reveals a great story of excellent research which was also commercially successful, fulfilling the aims of European Union grants. It is also a story of ageless friendship, only possible due to the vision and guidance of an exceptional manager: Moh Daha.

26019947|t|An early-detection programme for prostate cancer in Saudi men: A call from a tertiary-care centre in the Eastern province.
26019947|a|OBJECTIVE: To review the mode of presentation and clinical course of patients with prostate cancer during a specified period, as the detection rate is tending to increase, with most patients presenting at an advanced stage, and yet the overall incidence and prevalence rates are low. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all aspects of care for patients who were diagnosed between May 2006 and July 2010. RESULTS: In all, 76 men had a histologically confirmed prostatic adenocarcinoma diagnosed between May 2006 and July 2010 (mean age 71.1  years, SD 8). The median (range) prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis was 52 (1.2-16,230) ng/mL. Of the patients, 74% had a Gleason grade of       7 on diagnosis, and 64% had extraprostatic disease on presentation. Active surveillance was adopted in four patients, and four others were maintained on watchful waiting. Six patients had a radical prostatectomy, in one of whom it was a salvage procedure. Six patients received external-beam radical radiotherapy, five of whom had neoadjuvant, concurrent and adjuvant hormonal therapy. All remaining patients were treated primarily with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Of the patients on hormonal manipulation, in 56% the cancer became castrate-resistant within the mean (SD) follow-up of 17.2 (15) months. Of patients treated primarily with ADT, 34% died. The death rate among the whole group was 23%. Both percentages include both prostate cancer-specific and non-specific mortality. CONCLUSION: An advanced stage of disease at presentation mandates an early-detection, hospital-based screening programme. Further research should include many more patients and be based in several centres.

26019199|t|Clinical and analytical evaluation of a single vial stool collection device with formalin free fixative for improved processing and comprehensive detection of gastrointestinal parasites.
26019199|a|UNASSIGNED: Microscropic examination of feces is a standard laboratory method for diagnosing gastrointestinal parasite infections. In North America, the ova and parasite (O_P) examination is typically performed using stool that is chemically fixed in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and formalin, after which the stool is concentrated by filtration to enhance sensitivity. Mini Parasep   SF tubes allow for collection and concentration within a single collection vial. The goal of the study was to determine whether consolidated processing and concentration with the Parasep   tubes using an alcohol-based fixative (Alcorfix  ) provides equivalent or better O_P examinations than processing of PVA/formalin-fixed stool using SpinCon   concentration. Parasep   tubes revealed equivalent filtration performance versus SpinCon   using PVA/formalin-fixed stool containing protozoa. Specimens co-collected in PVA/formalin and Alcorfix   in Parasep   tubes revealed comparable morphology and staining for various protozoa. Alcorfix   was effectively fixed live Cryptosporidium and Microsporidia such that morphology and staining was conserved for modified acid-fast and modified trichrome stains. A workflow analysis revealed significant time savings for batches of 10 or 30 O_P specimens compared to the same number of specimens in PVA/formalin tubes. Direct hands-on time savings with mini Parasep   tubes were 17:41 and 32:01 minutes for batches of 10 or 30 respectively. Parasep   tubes containing Alcorfix   provide significant workflow advantages to laboratories that process medium to high volumes of O_P specimens by streamlining processing and converting to a single tube. These improvements in workflow, reduction of formalin in the laboratory, and equivalent microscopy results are attractive advancements in O_P testing for North American diagnostic parasitology laboratories.

26017528|t|Surgery for treatment of refractory chronic cluster headache: toward standard procedures.
26017528|a|UNASSIGNED: The degree of disability due to chronic cluster headache refractory to conservative treatments justifies surgical procedures as second-line treatments. Many studies and reports nowadays confirm the efficacy of the two mostly used surgical techniques in such cases. Both deep brain stimulation and occipital nerve stimulation are in fact currently utilized for this purpose but the surgical technique has not yet been standardized. We describe the surgical steps of both procedures.

26016314|t|[Hypogastric arteries ligation: an experience in gynecological and obstetric patients at Hospital Universitario de Saltillo].
26016314|a|BACKGROUND: Pelvic hemorrhage is a potential complication that occurs performing an obstetric or gynecological surgery, it is essential to know the distribution of pelvic vascular supplement, and implement preventive measures, can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of hypogastric artery ligation, as a preventive and therapeutic measure of pelvic hemorrhage, this will give us new prospective lines for future investigation. METHODS: Retrospective observational study, in which all patient who were performed a surgical procedure and report hypogastric artery ligation at the Saltillo University Hospital, from January 2008 to July 2014 was studied. RESULTS: 41 patients were obtained with hypogastric artery ligation, 28 gynecological and 13 obstetric patients. Among gynecological indications, cancer surgery represents 67.85%, benign lesions 25% and pelvic abscess 7.12%. Obstetric indications were uterine hypotonia with 46%, placenta previa with 23.07% and uterine fibroids, broad ligament hematoma and abruptio placenta a total of 30.7%. There was one complication in relation with technique that was a laceration of internal iliac artery without any consequence linked to this. And uterine preserving of 62% was observed in obstetric patients. CONCLUSIONS: This technique is a feasible and safe for preventive and therapeutic management of pelvic surgery, with a low incidence of complications 3.5% in gynecological patients and 0% in obstetric, with a mortality of 0%.

26019055|t|Transanal Minimally Invasive Surgery (TAMIS): Standardizing a Reproducible Procedure.
26019055|a|BACKGROUND: The recent introduction of transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) offers a safe and cost-effective method for the local resection of rectal neoplasms. The ability to standardize a technique for TAMIS will lead to the most reproducible outcomes and enable teaching. METHODS: A retrospective, IRB-approved chart review was conducted of 32 patients who underwent the TAMIS procedure at one institution over a 3-year period. RESULTS: TAMIS was performed for 11 benign and 21 malignant lesions. The majority of resections were full thickness (29/32) and all were R0. Average distance from the anal verge was 7.5        3  cm, defect circumference was 43.7        10  %, operative time was 131        80  min, and length of stay was 1.1        1  days. Two patients had morbidities requiring readmission and further treatment for (1) an aspiration pneumonia with CHF exacerbation and (2) a rectal abscess. CONCLUSIONS: This report outlines an operative technique for TAMIS that is reproducible for the excision of rectal lesions, associated with low morbidity.

26017630|t|Bronchiectasis: A model for chronic bacterial infection inducing autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis.
26017630|a|UNASSIGNED: Objective Bronchiectasis (BR) is a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here we examine the potential of BR in generating rheumatoid factors (RFs) and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) in patients with BR alone and in patients with BR and RA (BRRA). Methods We studied 122 patients with BR alone, 50 BRRA, 50 RA without lung disease, with 87 asthma and 79 healthy subjects as controls. RFs were measured by an automated analyzer, and ACPA using CCP2. Fine specificities to citrullinated a-enolase (CEP-1), citrullinated vimentin (cVim) and fibrinogen (cFib) with their arginine control peptides (REP-1, Vim and Fib) measured by ELISA. Results In the BR patients 39% were ever smokers compared to 42% of the controls. Serum samples from BR patients had an increased frequency of RF (25%; p< 0.05) and 5% to CCP2, 7% to CEP-1, 7% to cVIM (all p=ns) and 12% cFib (p <0.05). There was also a corresponding increase in antibodies to the arginine-containing control peptides in the BR patients; REP-1, 19% (p< 0.01) and Vim, 16% (p<0.05), demonstrating that the ACPA response in BR is not citrulline-specific. Lack of citrulline specificity was further confirmed by absorption studies. In BRRA all ACPA specificities were highly citrulline-specific. Conclusion Bronchiectasis is an unusual but potent model for the induction of autoimmunity in RA by bacterial infection in the lung. Our study suggests that in the early stages of tolerance breakdown, the ACPA response is not citrulline-specific, but becomes more so in those patients with BR that develop BRRA.
